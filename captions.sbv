0:00:00.000,0:00:02.499
Of the use of artificial intelligence

0:00:02.499,0:00:05.009
in our societies

0:00:05.009,0:00:07.475
So today

0:00:07.475,0:00:12.571
Let's go back to today's discussion and workshop

0:00:12.571,0:00:15.950
I'm very much looking forward to do it of course

0:00:15.950,0:00:22.545
And I would like now maybe to give the flow to Jean-Yves Iatrides to say a few words

0:00:22.545,0:00:28.054
On the side of Air Liquide before moving to the representatives of Japanese embassy

0:00:28.054,0:00:30.000
Jean-Yves, the floor is yours

0:00:30.000,0:00:33.696
Thank you Sebastian, I hope you can hear me

0:00:33.696,0:00:36.894
Good morning, good afternoon, konnichiwa to all of you

0:00:36.894,0:00:42.931
So I'm Jean-Yves Iatrides, so I'm located in Japan

0:00:42.931,0:00:49.426
And I'm, in charge of the R&D activity of the Air Liquide Group for the Asia region

0:00:49.426,0:01:00.721
Thorough that as Sebastian said, it could look a bit strange to see Air Liquide as being part of this event

0:01:00.721,0:01:07.756
In fact, first of all, what is Air Liquide for the ones which don't know Air Liquide, or our colleagues in Japan maybe

0:01:07.756,0:01:10.739
Air Liquide is a company supplying industrial gases

0:01:10.739,0:01:15.396
In fact, we have been in Japan for more than 100 years

0:01:15.396,0:01:17.441
So we're not a newcomer in Japan

0:01:17.441,0:01:22.630
And of course being part of this exchange program with France and Japan

0:01:22.630,0:01:25.327
Is, I would say of use for us

0:01:25.327,0:01:27.806
And that's one reason

0:01:27.806,0:01:30.190
The second reason is that some hard innovation

0:01:30.190,0:01:37.058
As we know the heart of the company, and the company has been created a long time ago by an inventor

0:01:37.058,0:01:39.155
Which has been exploring in many fields

0:01:39.155,0:01:45.185
And I'm sure at least in some point of his career he's been catching the art also

0:01:45.185,0:01:50.710
And now what is very much the focus of the group

0:01:50.710,0:01:53.067
Is of course we need to transition

0:01:53.067,0:01:56.421
With the development of the hydrogen society

0:01:56.421,0:02:00.976
But also looking at any technology

0:02:00.976,0:02:04.979
that will allow us to develop a system that build future

0:02:04.979,0:02:09.671
And this question of AI is definitely one of the topics

0:02:09.671,0:02:12.861
that is very important in out minds

0:02:12.861,0:02:18.233
So the topic of the day is definitively

0:02:18.233,0:02:24.828
not directly linked between AI and the, we say unusual operation that we have in the company

0:02:24.828,0:02:28.754
But we have a feeling that such technology

0:02:28.754,0:02:30.953
or such new technology I would say,

0:02:30.953,0:02:32.507
which is really disruptive

0:02:32.507,0:02:41.759
Addressing, certainly the way we feel, we touch, (and) we get in contact with the things

0:02:41.759,0:02:47.601
cannot be only looked at from a short point view, or from a technical (or from) an engineer

0:02:47.601,0:02:51.272
I'm a very bad artist I'm an engineer

0:02:51.272,0:02:55.623
you know, dealing with numbers, dealing with mechanics, dealing with these kinds of things

0:02:55.623,0:03:03.831
But I'm still convinced that when we touch technology, and new technology especially, in the digital world

0:03:03.831,0:03:06.455
we have to look at it from a different angle

0:03:06.455,0:03:12.103
And this is one of the reasons we have been funding this and this year's program

0:03:12.103,0:03:16.501
at the Fondation France-Japon since the beginning of the creation

0:03:16.501,0:03:23.783
was to be about to approach topics from a more human science point of view

0:03:23.783,0:03:28.664
And honestly (that's uh) I think it's very interesting

0:03:28.664,0:03:30.811
it's complementary to what we do

0:03:30.811,0:03:34.586
And therefore I'm very delighted to be part of you today,

0:03:34.586,0:03:37.787
To listen I would be mostly listening

0:03:37.787,0:03:43.764
But again I had the opportunity to meet Eto-san in Paris

0:03:43.764,0:03:46.026
a few months ago when I was visiting Paris

0:03:46.026,0:03:51.578
And it was really interesting and I think we had a very nice discussion at our research center in Paris

0:03:51.578,0:03:56.057
And I think I'm looking forward for the presentation of today

0:03:56.057,0:03:57.977
Thank you very much for the invitation

0:03:57.977,0:04:01.374
Thank you, thank you very much Jean-Yves for your kind words

0:04:01.374,0:04:09.595
So now I would like to, before (the) what you are waiting for and you expected before the talk by Eto-san

0:04:09.595,0:04:16.030
I would like to give the flow to Mr. Takenouchi from Japanese embassy in Paris

0:04:16.030,0:04:21.325
to say a few words in the name of the Japanese authorities

0:04:21.325,0:04:26.287
Thank you for the kind introduction, My name is Yosuke Takenouchi

0:04:26.287,0:04:31.880
In charge of science and technology policies at the Embassy of Japan in France

0:04:31.880,0:04:35.132
And first of all, on behalf of the embassy,

0:04:35.132,0:04:40.660
I would like to congratulate you on the successful organization of today's workshop

0:04:40.660,0:04:45.903
As Covid continues to impose restrictions around the world

0:04:45.903,0:04:53.027
Science and technology-related events like this are still not as active as before

0:04:53.027,0:05:00.825
And under such circumstances I'm such delighted that today's event has come to be held

0:05:00.825,0:05:05.037
And I guess it was not an easy task to prepare

0:05:05.037,0:05:12.309
So I would express my sincere gratitude especially to Doctor Koichiro Eto

0:05:12.309,0:05:14.309
and Fondation France-Japon

0:05:14.309,0:05:19.396
and Air Liquide, and all the members involved for their efforts

0:05:19.396,0:05:25.023
And looking at the science and technology policies of both countries

0:05:25.023,0:05:29.864
In France, a research planning law has been enacted

0:05:29.864,0:05:35.849
That sets out the ten year research strategy starting in 2021

0:05:35.849,0:05:43.226
And similarly Japan has just formulated the science technology and innovation basic plan

0:05:43.226,0:05:49.505
which will run for five years starting in 2021 as well

0:05:49.505,0:05:59.588
And the main pillars for both plans are social transformation and strengthening of research capabilities

0:05:59.588,0:06:03.102
And education and human resources development

0:06:03.102,0:06:07.302
And I see there are so many similarities

0:06:07.302,0:06:11.557
In the challenges that Japan and France are facing

0:06:11.557,0:06:15.996
And needless to say among the social transformation

0:06:15.996,0:06:19.175
Brought about by advanced technologies

0:06:19.175,0:06:22.995
The impact of AI is enormous

0:06:22.995,0:06:27.610
And this is evident from reading the AI strategies

0:06:27.610,0:06:30.067
established in both countries

0:06:30.067,0:06:39.838
And discussing how we can make rapid social transformation more acceptable to society

0:06:39.838,0:06:46.198
is as important matters as technological development itself

0:06:46.198,0:06:52.148
So I understand that the theme of today's workshop is

0:06:52.148,0:06:57.844
to pursue the role of art as a solution to this question

0:06:57.844,0:07:01.697
which is a very interesting point of view

0:07:01.697,0:07:07.682
And I look forward to the presentation and the discussion of the participants today

0:07:07.682,0:07:12.191
And finally I would like to conclude my greetings

0:07:12.191,0:07:17.503
with a wish that today's workshop will be an opportunity

0:07:17.503,0:07:22.321
for our new collaborations across research fields and borders

0:07:22.321,0:07:23.561
Thank you very much

0:07:23.561,0:07:29.441
Thank you very much for your kind words Mr Takenouchi

0:07:29.441,0:07:36.402
And now it's time to give the flow to our colleague and friend Eto-san

0:07:36.402,0:07:44.048
so we hope you will enjoy this workshop

0:07:44.048,0:07:46.324
and enjoy the discussion as well

0:07:46.324,0:07:49.517
so the floor is yours, Ito-san, (in Japanese) douzo

0:07:49.517,0:07:54.031
Oh thank you very much. My name is Kouichiro Eto

0:07:54.031,0:07:58.866
And first, I would like to say thank you to all participants

0:07:58.866,0:08:01.785
Especially both speakers and audience

0:08:01.785,0:08:08.046
So I would like to tart my presentation without further moment

0:08:08.046,0:08:17.128
Okay, I would like to start my presentation

0:08:17.128,0:08:24.860
My title of the presentation is "Art brings the future to our society"

0:08:24.860,0:08:31.648
And I am a 2021 FFJ/Air Liquide Fellow at Fondation France-Japon

0:08:31.648,0:08:34.802
And also I am a researcher at AIST

0:08:34.802,0:08:44.367
First of all, I would like to thank everyone who helped me make this workshop possible

0:08:44.367,0:08:48.194
First I would like to thank Mr, Jean-Yves Iatrides

0:08:48.194,0:08:50.260
from Air-Liquid corporation

0:08:50.260,0:08:54.886
and professor Sebastien Lechevalier from Fondation France-Japon

0:08:54.886,0:08:57.820
who made this fellowship possible

0:08:57.820,0:08:59.467
Thank you very much!

0:08:59.467,0:09:04.057
And I would like also to thank to my colleagues at FFJ

0:09:04.057,0:09:08.971
*Fabian*-san and Eto-san, *Jodie*-san, and my colleague in Japan

0:09:08.971,0:09:10.971
Thank you for all

0:09:10.971,0:09:15.899
Before getting into the main topic

0:09:15.899,0:09:19.167
Let me explain the differences from the original plan

0:09:19.167,0:09:25.067
The initial plan was to investigate the cognitive differences in AI between Japan and the West,

0:09:25.067,0:09:30.275
However, it turned out to be difficult due to the reasons shown here

0:09:30.275,0:09:33.973
Therefore I have shifted the plan

0:09:33.973,0:09:37.028
I have defined the final objective

0:09:37.028,0:09:43.969
to investigate the relationship between AI and advanced technology in Europe

0:09:43.969,0:09:46.163
I appreciate your understandings

0:09:46.163,0:09:50.997
First, let me introduce myself

0:09:50.997,0:09:54.276
I have been working as an artist since the 90s

0:09:54.276,0:09:59.989
Then in 2002, I joined AIST and started working as a researcher

0:09:59.989,0:10:04.485
I would like to introduce two of my works

0:10:04.485,0:10:09.978
they are in common that they are works that they make the internet visible

0:10:09.978,0:10:17.000
This work is "Web Hopper"

0:10:17.000,0:10:19.619
You can see a world map on the screen

0:10:19.619,0:10:23.876
On this map you can see the user's web hopping trajectory

0:10:23.876,0:10:29.212
For example, let's say you are looking at a website in the US

0:10:29.212,0:10:32.457
Then you click a link to a Europe one

0:10:32.457,0:10:37.094
Then virtually you have jumped from the US to Europe

0:10:37.094,0:10:41.388
By analyzing internet traffic in real time

0:10:41.388,0:10:45.450
I could visualize the trajectory of web browsing

0:10:45.450,0:10:49.711
we published this work in 1996

0:10:49.711,0:10:53.017
we won the grand prix of Prix Ars Electronica

0:10:53.017,0:10:58.868
At that time, the work became a permanent exhibit

0:10:58.868,0:11:00.425
At the arts Ars Electronica center

0:11:00.425,0:11:05.395
We won the grand prix of Press Electronica

0:11:05.395,0:11:09.439
the press prize is the most prestigious award in this field

0:11:09.439,0:11:15.310
this exhibit is a hands-on model of the internet

0:11:15.310,0:11:19.176
This work shows how internet works

0:11:19.176,0:11:22.623
You can see a white table in front of you

0:11:22.623,0:11:24.737
And this is a terminal

0:11:24.737,0:11:29.371
Here you can make a packet with black and white balls

0:11:29.371,0:11:32.009
the first 8 balls are for an address

0:11:32.009,0:11:35.046
and the last eight balls are for data

0:11:35.046,0:11:39.270
You can only send one character at a time

0:11:39.270,0:11:42.570
Then press the "send" button

0:11:42.570,0:11:48.196
The packet goes through the internet

0:11:48.196,0:11:52.509
And the router moves the packet from the local area network to another network

0:11:52.509,0:11:55.794
So this is a routing table

0:11:55.794,0:12:03.040
And then a packet go from the (terminal) out to the internet

0:12:03.040,0:12:07.031
Then this is the destination terminal

0:12:07.031,0:12:10.680
The packet goes to the display of the terminal

0:12:10.680,0:12:19.051
Then the packet go into the display

0:12:19.051,0:12:25.918
You can see the content of the packet

0:12:25.918,0:12:28.012
which is a character "A"

0:12:28.012,0:12:32.485
We created this work in 2001

0:12:32.485,0:12:36.245
and you can still see it in the museum in Miraikan

0:12:36.245,0:12:40.242
If you have a chance to visit Tokyo

0:12:40.242,0:12:42.493
please drop by Miraikan!

0:12:42.493,0:12:49.781
What I would like to explain here is a period in the 90s

0:12:49.781,0:12:53.257
This age was a very early stage of the internet

0:12:53.257,0:12:56.775
At that time, the internet was an advanced technology

0:12:56.775,0:13:01.305
These works explain how the internet works

0:13:01.305,0:13:03.272
for the general public

0:13:03.272,0:13:09.533
Since 2002, I have been a researcher at AIST

0:13:09.533,0:13:15.298
continuing a research theme, how we can design a press for co-creation

0:13:15.298,0:13:23.259
The key concept of my research is that the users should design the system

0:13:23.259,0:13:27.598
This picture is of a famous architect Christopher Alexander

0:13:27.598,0:13:32.086
He said that the users should design the architecture

0:13:32.086,0:13:36.470
If we do that, we won't need architects anymore

0:13:36.470,0:13:41.023
Instead, he created a pattern language

0:13:41.023,0:13:43.309
to make this concept possible

0:13:43.309,0:13:46.413
a method to design architecture without architects

0:13:46.413,0:13:50.195
this idea is a key concept of my research

0:13:50.195,0:13:55.375
We created several co-creation platforms

0:13:55.375,0:13:58.685
that connects various fields based on this concept

0:13:58.685,0:14:03.025
The most significant achievement was the Niconico-Gakkai beta

0:14:03.025,0:14:09.218
We created a platform that connects the general public with professional researchers

0:14:09.218,0:14:14.642
Even if they are not working as professional researchers

0:14:14.642,0:14:16.959
there are still people doing research

0:14:16.959,0:14:19.964
We call them "Wild Researchers"

0:14:19.964,0:14:25.093
And we created a press for them to present their research with us

0:14:25.093,0:14:30.976
We started this project in 2011, and held 9 large scale symposiums

0:14:30.976,0:14:37.170
The first symposium attracted 110,000 audience on the internet

0:14:37.170,0:14:42.754
The total number of viewers was over 658,000 (615,000?) people

0:14:42.754,0:14:47.905
Since then I have expanded my activities as follows

0:14:47.905,0:14:55.327
I would like to share the latest research result of our research

0:14:55.327,0:15:01.031
In January of this year, we published this paper to classify

0:15:01.031,0:15:05.436
74 facial emojis on the valence-arousal axes

0:15:05.436,0:15:08.464
Pleasantness and intensity

0:15:08.464,0:15:14.689
We published this paper in scientific reports, and it is press released from Nature Asia

0:15:14.689,0:15:23.908
And now I would like to start explaining this fellowship result

0:15:23.908,0:15:29.805
First, I set the research question as "What is the role of art in advanced technology?"

0:15:29.805,0:15:35.239
then I would like to move onto the background method and findings

0:15:35.239,0:15:43.258
First, there are already some pioneering studies on the relationship between AI and art

0:15:43.258,0:15:50.706
First of all, there is a book "AI for creation" by professor Nao Tokui from Keio University

0:15:50.706,0:15:53.211
He is also a speaker at this workshop

0:15:53.211,0:15:56.475
His book is a very detailed description of

0:15:56.475,0:16:00.523
how can we use AI to develop human creativity

0:16:00.523,0:16:03.779
Also, professor Sofian Audry's book

0:16:03.779,0:16:05.851
"Art in the age of machine learning"

0:16:05.851,0:16:07.692
is published last year

0:16:07.692,0:16:12.229
Go back to the history of the computer art

0:16:12.229,0:16:14.916
This research is also excellent

0:16:14.916,0:16:24.520
Also the MDPI journal "Arts as a special institute" on "The Machine as Artist" in 2019

0:16:24.520,0:16:29.451
which includes 17 people's 17 papers

0:16:29.451,0:16:31.615
all of which are very worthwhile

0:16:31.615,0:16:38.787
And let's start with an explanation of observations in Europe

0:16:38.787,0:16:43.881
I visited various events and centers where arts and science are related

0:16:43.881,0:16:52.031
Ars Electronica is the most significant example in Europe

0:16:52.031,0:16:58.286
This center began as a media art festival in 1979

0:16:58.286,0:17:00.833
the oldest and biggest in the world

0:17:00.833,0:17:05.840
They started Prix Ars Electronica in 1987

0:17:05.840,0:17:10.203
the award is the most highly regarded in the media-art field

0:17:10.203,0:17:17.751
In 1996, they opened the Ars Electronica center as shown in this picture

0:17:17.751,0:17:20.994
And they also started an R&D center

0:17:20.994,0:17:23.816
called "Future Lab" in the same building

0:17:23.816,0:17:28.483
But my relationship with Ars Electronica is strong

0:17:28.483,0:17:32.173
I recieved the Prix Ars Electronica three times

0:17:32.173,0:17:34.811
Including the Grand Prix of 1997

0:17:34.811,0:17:42.938
From my point of view, the most significant result of future lab is Spaxels

0:17:42.938,0:17:47.894
They started the project in 2012

0:17:47.894,0:17:52.317
to draw pictures in the sky using drones

0:17:52.317,0:17:55.372
They named this project "Spaxels"

0:17:55.372,0:17:58.296
The meaning is "pixels in space"

0:17:58.296,0:18:03.398
I saw the initial launch event at Linz in 2012

0:18:03.398,0:18:10.618
In honest, I felt that the light was so weak and unreliable at that time

0:18:10.618,0:18:13.670
But this project grew steadily

0:18:13.670,0:18:18.474
In 2015, they started a joint research with Intel

0:18:18.474,0:18:21.388
And they developed this project far away

0:18:21.388,0:18:28.436
In 2021, Intel drew a symbol mark of Tokyo 2020

0:18:28.436,0:18:31.270
At the opening ceremony of Tokyo (Olympics)

0:18:31.270,0:18:39.515
And they held the Ars Electronica festival in 2021 again

0:18:39.515,0:18:41.820
but it was a hybrid event

0:18:41.820,0:18:47.051
Usually the festival attracts so many artists from all over the world

0:18:47.051,0:18:51.889
But this year, there was almost no artists from overseas

0:18:51.889,0:18:53.961
It was a quiet event

0:18:53.961,0:18:59.908
But I found an excellent exhibit

0:18:59.908,0:19:06.090
Future Lab also produces exhibits for the Ars Electronica Center

0:19:06.090,0:19:11.328
In this video you can see 11 monitors in front of you

0:19:11.328,0:19:16.303
In these monitors you can see the hidden layers of DNN

0:19:16.303,0:19:21.096
As you know, there are many layers behind the deep neural network

0:19:21.096,0:19:25.986
And this exhibit shows the mechanism of the DNN very well

0:19:25.986,0:19:33.589
In detail, they use the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with the VGG16 network

0:19:33.589,0:19:37.663
I think this is a simple idea but effective

0:19:37.663,0:19:43.521
By showing the layers all at once, we can see how the DNN works

0:19:43.521,0:19:52.523
I had a chance to interview Hideaki Ogawa, the co-director of the Future Lab

0:19:52.523,0:19:55.696
I was impressed by his words,

0:19:55.696,0:19:59.230
Just as water comes out when you twist the tap

0:19:59.230,0:20:04.022
The future comes out when you type "twist the tap" at the Ars Electronica Center

0:20:04.022,0:20:09.216
He is also an artist still creating their artworks

0:20:09.216,0:20:17.751
Events like this Ars Electronica are now taking place in other cities

0:20:17.751,0:20:24.036
In Paris, there is a similar event called the Némo Biennale

0:20:24.036,0:20:30.462
They held the event at Centquatre and various other locations in Paris

0:20:30.462,0:20:35.026
They designed this event to connect science and art

0:20:35.026,0:20:43.612
I participated in this event and I felt that the direction was so close to the Ars Electronica Festival

0:20:43.612,0:20:49.538
And there are events called Maker Faire

0:20:49.538,0:20:54.205
where people who like to make things gather and show their creations

0:20:54.205,0:21:00.806
The maker faire events are all over the world, and the Nantes Maker Campus was outstanding quality

0:21:00.806,0:21:07.675
And also, I am a director of Tsukuba Mini Maker faire

0:21:07.675,0:21:14.462
Then I met several artists and interviewed them

0:21:14.462,0:21:20.042
First let me introduce "La Machine"

0:21:20.042,0:21:22.793
The moving giant elephant of Nantes

0:21:22.793,0:21:30.000
In the city of Nantes, big elephant carried a lot of people around the city everyday

0:21:30.000,0:21:35.925
And I had a chance to interview the artistic director Mr. Francois Delaroziere

0:21:35.925,0:21:44.080
And according to him, it is important to have such huge artwork moving around the public open city and open space

0:21:44.080,0:21:48.897
And I felt that this is loved by the citizens very much

0:21:48.897,0:21:56.193
From Francois Delaroziere

0:21:56.193,0:22:00.714
I was particularly interested in his focus on movement

0:22:00.714,0:22:08.907
And according to him, movement is a language (of) a machine, and a mechanical organisms

0:22:08.907,0:22:14.380
The next artist is Scott Eaton

0:22:14.380,0:22:17.408
The picture on the left is a finished painting

0:22:17.408,0:22:23.056
The video on the right side shows how he is drawing it

0:22:23.056,0:22:28.550
As you can see, it is just a simple sketch with an outline

0:22:28.550,0:22:33.576
But the AI automatically drew the content with human body

0:22:33.576,0:22:37.505
Scott Eaton has a background in art

0:22:37.505,0:22:41.292
and he also graduated from the MIT media lab

0:22:41.292,0:22:43.964
so he is very good at computer science

0:22:43.964,0:22:50.325
And he studied drawing and sculpture in Florence in Italy

0:22:50.325,0:22:55.229
I think his paintings are under the influence of Michelangelo

0:22:55.229,0:23:02.934
I had the opportunity to interview him, and it was fascinating

0:23:02.934,0:23:08.688
I think he has a great philosophy as an artist who uses AI

0:23:08.688,0:23:12.245
In particular I would like to emphasize the word

0:23:12.245,0:23:15.740
"For an artist, failure is sometimes beautiful"

0:23:15.740,0:23:20.566
I think this is a natural appeal of media art

0:23:20.566,0:23:24.231
Creating art through repeated experimentations

0:23:24.231,0:23:29.416
Next up is Fernado Magalhães

0:23:29.416,0:23:34.229
As you can see, he created a computer graphics image

0:23:34.229,0:23:36.677
that looks like Japanese superheroes

0:23:36.677,0:23:41.029
He didn't make these images by hand

0:23:41.029,0:23:44.655
But he designed an algorithm to create superheroes

0:23:44.655,0:23:52.793
Based on that algorithm the program generates countless superhero's shapes automatically

0:23:52.793,0:23:57.688
This kind of art is what we call "Generative Art"

0:23:57.688,0:24:01.596
I interviewed him also

0:24:01.596,0:24:04.654
He was born in São Paulo Brazil

0:24:04.654,0:24:07.830
and watched Japanese TV programs in childhood

0:24:07.830,0:24:13.010
So it was there that he came in contact with Japanese culture

0:24:13.010,0:24:15.793
and begin to create these kinds of works

0:24:15.793,0:24:24.576
So I would like to explain what I have learned from these experiences

0:24:24.576,0:24:31.982
First of all I would like to say that I have (never) been to more places

0:24:31.982,0:24:36.618
One that most impressed me was Grotte Chauvet

0:24:36.618,0:24:46.240
This Grotte Chauvet is a cave mural that exists about 36 thousand years old

0:24:46.240,0:24:52.613
Lascaux cave is 20 thousand years old

0:24:52.613,0:24:55.962
So this is probably the oldest cave mural

0:24:55.962,0:25:02.484
We see here a replica of Grotte Chauvet called Grotte Chauvet 2

0:25:02.484,0:25:06.227
Although it is a replica it is so realistic

0:25:06.227,0:25:09.764
It looks like (the) real thing is here

0:25:09.764,0:25:15.061
Here is a mural of lions, but it exists within the same reality

0:25:15.061,0:25:17.605
I was very impressed by this

0:25:17.605,0:25:28.150
And before I came to France, I thought that this "Europe" was a place where the modern western culture has developed

0:25:28.150,0:25:30.312
But that was not the case

0:25:30.312,0:25:36.975
I mean the coast of Mediterranean sea is where civilization begun

0:25:36.975,0:25:40.385
I was finally able to understand this

0:25:40.385,0:25:48.363
Then what force drives the progress of civilization?

0:25:48.363,0:25:55.170
The science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson invented the term "Metaverse"

0:25:55.170,0:25:57.523
in his novel Snow Crash

0:25:57.523,0:26:03.884
In this book, he says that there are some layers of languages

0:26:03.884,0:26:09.500
And the civilization progress is through the power of crossing between these layers

0:26:09.500,0:26:16.155
In his word, "Code" or programming language, is a latest language layer

0:26:16.155,0:26:21.504
A language defines our thinking

0:26:21.504,0:26:27.716
It is difficult to share a concept that has not yet been put into words

0:26:27.716,0:26:30.164
Please imagine this:

0:26:30.164,0:26:37.500
How would you tell yourself in 2019 what was the changes brought by Covid-19

0:26:37.500,0:26:43.422
I think you will find it a bit difficult

0:26:43.422,0:26:49.311
Once a common language is established, sharing concepts becomes possible

0:26:49.311,0:26:57.921
And the role of human in a society is dictated by the measure of technological changes

0:26:57.921,0:27:02.810
The industrial revolution was governed by natural laws

0:27:02.810,0:27:07.410
In particular, how to control engines was very important

0:27:07.410,0:27:14.711
Locomotive automobiles, looms, and letter presses are all powered by engines

0:27:14.711,0:27:21.503
Please remember that the term "engineering" comes from engine

0:27:21.503,0:27:27.897
On the other hand, the IT revolution is governed by language

0:27:27.897,0:27:35.757
So when we can express it in a language, we can execute it

0:27:35.757,0:27:40.739
For example, we often compare a hacker to a wizard

0:27:40.739,0:27:45.292
When a wizard casts a spell, it becomes true

0:27:45.292,0:27:50.532
In this situation, "the spell" means a programming language

0:27:50.532,0:27:59.040
And next, let's consider the AI revolution that is taking place

0:27:59.040,0:28:03.694
I believe that AI is governed by imagination

0:28:03.694,0:28:08.678
In AI, everything exists in a probabilistic way

0:28:08.678,0:28:13.702
There is not rigid distinction between 0 or 1

0:28:13.702,0:28:20.032
From my point of view, this is closer to painting than language

0:28:20.032,0:28:26.373
I mean, In other words, what can be visualized can be executed

0:28:26.373,0:28:37.743
I remind Scott Eaton's statement that "The artist controls the AI with his imagination and ideas" is a perfect example of this

0:28:37.743,0:28:41.753
So I would like to return to the research question

0:28:41.753,0:28:44.783
What is the role of art in advanced technology

0:28:44.783,0:28:49.122
My findings are to be a source of imaginations

0:28:49.122,0:28:53.938
and expands the possibilities to advance the technology

0:28:53.938,0:28:58.008
So I would like to end my presentation

0:28:58.008,0:28:59.934
And thank you very much

0:29:09.297,0:29:12.888
Then

0:29:12.888,0:29:17.862
Can I go progress?

0:29:17.862,0:29:24.625
Yes please, I will give you the floor to organize the round table thank you very much!

0:29:24.625,0:29:26.068
There will be

0:29:26.068,0:29:27.867
I think there will be many questions

0:29:27.867,0:29:31.503
And congratulations of course though on your talk

0:29:31.503,0:29:38.249
But I think in order to have a good discussion it's good to move to the round table

0:29:38.249,0:29:41.801
and then to have the discussion

0:29:41.801,0:29:43.942
Ok thank you very much

0:29:43.942,0:29:47.880
Then let's start the session one

0:29:47.880,0:29:53.400
So in session one we have a presentation from *Attos* first

0:29:53.400,0:29:58.200
Then we will have a presentation from Nao Tokui from Keio University

0:29:58.200,0:30:02.765
Tokui-sensei, could you please start your presentation?

0:30:02.765,0:30:07.877
Hi, yes, thank you!

0:30:07.877,0:30:10.552
(in Japanese) Kikoemasuka? Do you hear me?

0:30:10.552,0:30:13.114
Uh yes, clearly!

0:30:13.114,0:30:14.370
Thank you very much

0:30:14.370,0:30:19.323
Ok so, hi everyone

0:30:19.323,0:30:21.673
Bonjour, thank you for having me

0:30:21.673,0:30:24.441
So let me start my presentation

0:30:24.441,0:30:27.972
So can I share my screen?

0:30:48.654,0:30:53.339
Normally, you can share, you have the right to share that

0:30:53.339,0:30:55.954
yes

0:30:55.954,0:30:58.045
Ok, thanks!

0:30:58.045,0:31:02.122
So today I will talk about AI and creativity

0:31:02.122,0:31:05.471
And before that let me introduce myself

0:31:05.471,0:31:07.530
So my name is Nao Tokui

0:31:07.530,0:31:10.525
I'm an artist and researcher

0:31:10.525,0:31:19.650
And also I'm a founder and CEO of Tokyo based art collective Qosmo

0:31:19.650,0:31:24.470
And I also organized

0:31:24.470,0:31:31.095
computational creativity laboratory at Keio University in Japan

0:31:31.095,0:31:35.509
So today, I want to talk about

0:31:35.509,0:31:37.208
AI and creativity

0:31:37.208,0:31:41.806
And Especially the main theme of my talk is this:

0:31:41.806,0:31:46.187
Is AI capable of creating something new and original?

0:31:46.187,0:31:55.732
Maybe more precisely: Is AI capable of helping us create something new and original

0:31:55.732,0:32:00.751
rather than imitating what we humans have already created

0:32:00.751,0:32:07.613
So why I got interested in this topic

0:32:07.613,0:32:10.402
Is this,

0:32:10.402,0:32:15.548
I entered the University of Tokyo in 1995

0:32:15.548,0:32:22.972
And joined the laboratory, I mean the AI laboratory in 1998

0:32:22.972,0:32:28.322
And also at the same time, I started DJ'ing myself

0:32:28.322,0:32:32.969
And I got kind of obsessed with music

0:32:32.969,0:32:43.032
And I started thinking like "I want to create music, I want to create new music nobody ever listened to"

0:32:43.032,0:32:44.205
so

0:32:44.205,0:32:47.949
But I don't play any musical instruments

0:32:47.949,0:32:51.716
and I don't barely read musical scores

0:32:51.716,0:32:54.299
so how can I make interesting music

0:32:54.299,0:32:59.134
so naturally I turned to programming and AI

0:32:59.134,0:33:08.031
So here, I'm not interested in optimizing and streamlining the music making process

0:33:08.031,0:33:14.084
to make more hit songs more economically

0:33:14.084,0:33:19.385
Rather, instead, I'm interested in

0:33:19.385,0:33:23.718
diversification and deviation

0:33:23.718,0:33:28.315
so how can I make something unique

0:33:28.315,0:33:37.694
music, you know basically a new music

0:33:37.694,0:33:44.973
And here I have an agenda of my talk today

0:33:44.973,0:33:49.543
So I want to talk about three topics

0:33:49.543,0:33:55.257
And first one is "Misusable" AI tools

0:33:55.257,0:34:02.356
The importance of music tools you can misuse

0:34:02.356,0:34:15.300
And you may find it a little bit strange to use the word "misuse" in the discussion of AI

0:34:15.300,0:34:23.600
But when you look back the history of music and other creative fields

0:34:23.600,0:34:33.624
you may realize that it is in fact a history of misuse and misappropriated new technologies

0:34:33.624,0:34:46.898
So one of the recurring patterns is when an artist use new technologies in a way the original inventor didn't intend or imagine

0:34:46.898,0:34:51.258
It is when new form of expression emerge

0:34:51.258,0:34:59.588
So the prime example of these misused technology is for example

0:34:59.588,0:35:03.861
turn table and samplers

0:35:03.861,0:35:11.133
So as for turn tables, you are not supposed to touch and move the vinyl record right?

0:35:11.133,0:35:21.394
And samplers were invented to imitate expensive physical instruments such as pianos and violins

0:35:21.394,0:35:30.397
But the inventor didn't expect users to appropriate and sample somebody else's records and musics

0:35:30.397,0:35:35.196
Such as Funky Drummers or Aiming Brakes or whatever

0:35:35.196,0:35:44.341
And when we think about the current status of AI music tools

0:35:44.341,0:35:47.235
or AI creative tools in general

0:35:47.235,0:35:55.900
You see both extreme ends of spectrum here

0:35:55.900,0:36:06.811
On one hand, you have programmer oriented tools

0:36:06.811,0:36:16.017
like, so you need to install Python and Tensor Flow and you need CUDA of course

0:36:16.017,0:36:24.367
And you know, you need to get used to these tools to make something unique or something new

0:36:24.367,0:36:34.364
And I'm sure some artists can learn and train themselves to get used to these tools

0:36:34.364,0:36:37.930
but usually it's not the case

0:36:37.930,0:36:43.855
And at the other end of the spectrum, we have

0:36:43.855,0:36:49.085
very well-packaged tools, AI tools

0:36:49.085,0:37:00.000
So with one click you can generate a music or with one click the AI can edit your photo, or images, you know

0:37:00.000,0:37:05.370
And in some cases, that's good

0:37:05.370,0:37:09.955
But I think if the tool is too well packaged

0:37:09.955,0:37:21.539
then you cannot "misuse" or you cannot use these tools in your own way, or in your own creative way

0:37:21.539,0:37:32.405
So I think we need something in between these two ends of the spectrum

0:37:32.405,0:37:36.823
And I call it "Misusable" AI tools

0:37:36.823,0:37:47.791
And following this principal, I created a simple AI tool for musicians

0:37:47.791,0:37:57.645
And it is on Ableton Live, a famous digital audio workstation software

0:37:57.645,0:38:06.847
And yeah, so this is an Ableton Live plugin

0:38:06.847,0:38:15.618
And what it does is it allows you as artist to train your own AI model

0:38:15.618,0:38:22.697
within this software, so you don't have to deal with Python and CUDA

0:38:22.697,0:38:30.658
So only thing you need to do is just collect music data, in this case MIDI files

0:38:30.658,0:38:33.875
and drag and drop on this device

0:38:33.875,0:38:47.169
And voila, you got a trained model on this device, and you can generate new rhythms continuously

0:38:47.169,0:38:49.770
And you can:

0:38:49.770,0:38:51.396
♫sick beats♫

0:38:51.396,0:38:53.472
I hope you can hear the audio

0:38:53.472,0:39:04.476
♫sick beats♫

0:39:04.476,0:39:09.927
And a good thing about this tool is that you can actually "misuse" this tool

0:39:09.927,0:39:15.209
So you can train your model with very obscure data sets

0:39:15.209,0:39:28.033
or, I don't know, this device is meant for rhythm generation, but you can train your own model with a melody data, for example

0:39:28.033,0:39:32.715
and see what comes out

0:39:32.715,0:39:39.737
Ok, that's one small project I did in 2020

0:39:39.737,0:39:45.598
And I want to talk about the second topic here

0:39:45.598,0:39:52.214
Which is embracing the uncertainty or errors AI brings

0:39:52.214,0:40:05.527
So this is a visualization of the output of the same model I just introduced

0:40:05.527,0:40:14.230
And this is useful and great, and also you can misuse this tools to generate something unique

0:40:14.230,0:40:18.632
But still you need your own training data to train this model

0:40:18.632,0:40:28.117
And mainly you can say like this model is still imitating human creation with AI, right?

0:40:28.117,0:40:36.470
So in 2017 I created something called "Neural Beatbox"

0:40:36.470,0:40:41.963
So what I did is to combine rhythm generation model, the same rhythm generation model,

0:40:41.963,0:40:45.481
with a sound classification model

0:40:45.481,0:40:55.992
And you can play this neural beatbox on this website neuralbeatbox.net

0:40:55.992,0:40:59.760
so if you're interested please take a look

0:40:59.760,0:41:09.080
what I did was to integrate the sound classification model with the rhythm generation model

0:41:09.080,0:41:16.180
And generated rhythm pattern will be played

0:41:16.180,0:41:20.946
with the instant drum kit

0:41:20.946,0:41:25.743
the sound classification model created out of the recorded sound materials

0:41:25.743,0:41:29.360
♫beatbox♫

0:41:29.360,0:41:36.033
So we created this website during the Covid lockdown

0:41:36.033,0:41:48.490
on this website you create your own beat with the help of AI and you can share your sessions with your friends

0:41:48.490,0:41:55.557
So that you can join your instant beatbox session

0:41:55.557,0:42:03.782
And I should mention that sound classification is not perfect of course

0:42:03.782,0:42:06.858
but that's what we wanted

0:42:06.858,0:42:17.283
We wanted to deviate from what humans have created

0:42:17.283,0:42:30.142
♫sick session♫

0:42:30.142,0:42:34.450
Ok ,so what I just said is like this

0:42:34.450,0:42:43.569
so when you try to create something new and unique you want to deviate and branch out from the conventions or common senses

0:42:43.569,0:42:49.134
And we hope it will be a manifestation of creativity, but sometimes,

0:42:49.134,0:43:03.739
Especially from a conventional perspective, these deviation can be just a mistake or an error, right?

0:43:03.739,0:43:10.157
So we need to know how to embrace the mistakes

0:43:10.157,0:43:27.073
And you have to know how to differentiate mistakes from, you know, a manifestation of creativity

0:43:27.073,0:43:41.723
And this error and creativity is one of my main theme I think

0:43:41.723,0:43:49.476
So the other project where I embrace the uncertainty of AI is this AI DJ project

0:43:49.476,0:43:54.277
It's a back-to-back DJ session with me

0:43:54.277,0:43:59.898
and AI DJ

0:43:59.898,0:44:09.995
and AI DJ selects and plays sometimes unexpected songs

0:44:09.995,0:44:14.678
But this uncertainty leads to very interesting DJ performance

0:44:14.678,0:44:28.573
So sometimes the AI selects something I didn't expect or I couldn't imagine

0:44:28.573,0:44:41.733
But this unexpectedness was so interesting as a DJ

0:44:41.733,0:44:54.507
And we are so fortunate to have opportunities to play at various locations including Google I/O in San Francisco

0:44:54.507,0:44:57.568
and Scopitone festival in Nantes

0:44:57.568,0:45:13.599
So we extended this scene and we turned it into a real-time AI jam session

0:45:13.599,0:45:24.801
♫sick jam session♫

0:45:24.801,0:45:34.878
I hope you can listen to and hear the audio now

0:45:34.878,0:45:38.587
(In Japanese) Daijoubukana?

0:45:38.587,0:45:47.051
Anyway, so instead of letting AI to select existing music

0:45:47.051,0:45:54.122
We made an AI system that makes music on stage in real time

0:45:54.122,0:45:59.361
So in this performance, three AI models, namely

0:45:59.361,0:46:08.455
rhythm generation model, baseline generation, and loop selection interact with each other

0:46:08.455,0:46:11.404
And keep improvising a dance track

0:46:11.404,0:46:19.898
So I as a DJ intervene the processor by manipulating mixer and adding a sound in the turn table

0:46:19.898,0:46:28.676
So it's not a disk jockey anymore, it's more like a machine jockey or an AI jockey

0:46:28.676,0:46:38.248
Ok, so finally I want to talk about this, pushing AI to the edge

0:46:38.248,0:46:45.788
And so let's get back to the original question: Is AI capable of creating something new and original

0:46:45.788,0:46:52.780
So here I want to talk about Generative Adversarial Network

0:46:52.780,0:46:58.212
So it's a famous framework so I'm not going to explain it in detail

0:46:58.212,0:47:07.626
But it's so famous for the capability of generating very realistic faces

0:47:07.626,0:47:12.994
But here, I want to use it for, again rhythm patterns

0:47:12.994,0:47:24.756
And in this model I added a conditioning input

0:47:24.756,0:47:32.428
so you can specify the genre, and generate patterns

0:47:32.428,0:47:41.770
*silence*

0:47:41.770,0:47:47.000
do you hear the audio? I cannot hear

0:47:47.000,0:47:49.715
Uh I cannot hear

0:47:49.715,0:47:51.647
somehow

0:47:51.647,0:47:53.789
Good? No?

0:47:53.789,0:47:55.619
No

0:47:55.619,0:48:18.696
*deafening silence*

0:48:18.696,0:48:24.863
Sorry, do it again

0:48:24.863,0:48:28.057
*drum plays for a second*

0:48:28.057,0:48:30.242
Ok

0:48:30.242,0:48:38.615
*silence*

0:48:38.615,0:48:49.815
So again, I added a conditional input so that you can specify the genre of the generated rhythm patterns

0:48:49.815,0:48:58.019
But it's not interesting, so I added another discriminator to this model

0:48:58.019,0:49:13.192
I added another discriminator that is for classifying the genre of the generated rhythms

0:49:13.192,0:49:20.935
So the generator is trained to confuse the additional discriminator as well

0:49:20.935,0:49:32.940
so that it can generate realistic rhythm patterns that don't belong to any genres in the training data set

0:49:32.940,0:49:37.060
So this is the result

0:49:37.060,0:49:42.523
*sick beat ensues*

0:49:42.523,0:49:47.547
I hope you can hear, I don't I can hear (Yes we can, and it's awesome!)

0:49:47.547,0:49:50.350
(In Japanese) Daijoobudesuka?

0:49:50.350,0:50:07.742
*sick hit-hat beats*

0:50:07.742,0:50:19.989
So here, I wanted to realize the tag of war between conventions and deviations

0:50:19.989,0:50:30.084
So now AI is trying to tell which deviation is good and interesting

0:50:30.084,0:50:36.498
And this is I believe what human artists do actually

0:50:36.498,0:50:44.334
And finally I want to introduce one of my favorite quotes of Scott Adams

0:50:44.334,0:50:52.060
He's a famous comic writer of Dilbert comic strip

0:50:52.060,0:51:00.000
And it goes like this: Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep

0:51:00.000,0:51:10.937
And in the context of AI and creativity I think AI is a tool that helps you make interesting, meaningful, and amusing mistakes

0:51:10.937,0:51:17.239
And consequently, it helps you to create something new and original

0:51:17.239,0:51:26.457
Ok, finally as Eto-san introduced, I published this book last year

0:51:26.457,0:51:36.966
And I'm working on English translation, and hopefully I can deliver it within a few months

0:51:36.966,0:51:42.124
Ok, so thank you so much!

0:51:42.124,0:51:49.503
Thank you very much Tokui-sensei, I loved the presentation very much

0:51:49.503,0:51:51.458
I'm sorry about the audio trouble

0:51:51.458,0:51:57.883
No no, no problem, I have so much questions for Professor Tokui

0:51:57.883,0:52:06.521
But on this program, I will do the presentation for session one and all

0:52:06.521,0:52:10.099
Then we'll have a 10 minutes Q and A

0:52:10.099,0:52:14.944
So I would like to do this and to next presenter

0:52:24.720,0:52:34.880
can you hear me yes yes okay thank you very much 
for accepting uh the speaker of this lecture

0:52:36.160,0:52:39.840
would you please start your 
presentation as i can say okay

0:52:43.520,0:52:45.840
here you are

0:52:48.160,0:52:58.080
can you see it yes perfect all right so 
uh my presentation will be by about my erc

0:52:58.080,0:53:04.800
european research council advanced grant 
reach raising co-creativity in cyber human

0:53:06.160,0:53:12.720
musicianship first of all let me present ircam 
the place where i'm i am a researcher so irkam

0:53:12.720,0:53:19.120
is instituted the coordination acoustic music with 
actually a part of saint george pompidou in paris

0:53:19.120,0:53:25.040
it was created by famous conductor and composer 
pierre bules in the uh 70s when the when the

0:53:25.040,0:53:33.360
sun pompidou was created and it is the the music 
music and sound research parts of centro pompidou

0:53:33.360,0:53:42.560
so we have a three part in irkam a research lab 
called science and technology of sound and music

0:53:42.560,0:53:47.680
who is operated by cnrs and strawberry 
university and irkam of course and the

0:53:47.680,0:53:52.960
minister of the culture communication we 
have we have a music creation department

0:53:54.000,0:54:02.640
with concert halls and composers in residence and 
music commissions etc and we have an education

0:54:02.640,0:54:09.200
department where we have a master's program 
first for young scientists and another program

0:54:09.200,0:54:14.480
in technology for musicians so it's a very 
original model of innovation and creativity

0:54:15.280,0:54:21.040
uh where we have artists that are 
immersed into a research context

0:54:23.360,0:54:31.440
all right so in irkam i have created a team called 
music representation team years ago and now it has

0:54:31.440,0:54:38.960
become the biggest team in irkam and we have 
a lot of researchers on ai and creativity for

0:54:39.760,0:54:46.640
artistic purposes specifically music 
so we have five poles in this team so

0:54:46.640,0:54:54.640
certain of these polls are concerned with music 
composition formalization uh formal approaches

0:54:54.640,0:54:59.920
to music but we have the three poles here are 
really concerned with artificial intelligence

0:54:59.920,0:55:09.920
so reach is really the the the project that i will 
be uh speaking about acid is a a project that is

0:55:09.920,0:55:15.200
highly oriented towards the machine learning for 
creative applications and activities is really

0:55:15.200,0:55:21.760
oriented towards the idea of time and how you 
write and control the time in an interactive setup

0:55:23.840,0:55:30.320
so to give an example uh there is a here 
is a program that i wrote many years ago

0:55:31.040,0:55:37.440
and has now become the standard all over the world 
for a computer-assisted composition it's called

0:55:37.440,0:55:44.640
open music and we have published three books where 
thousands of composers explain how they would use

0:55:44.640,0:55:49.920
open music to create new music so open music 
is actually a programming language but it is a

0:55:49.920,0:55:56.160
visual programming language so composers learn how 
to program more easily because it's totally visual

0:55:56.160,0:56:01.920
and they can design new musical application so 
this is not the artificial intelligence approach

0:56:01.920,0:56:08.240
this is the formal approaches where composers 
actually have to specify the algorithm that they

0:56:08.240,0:56:14.320
want to use in order to create music after having 
created open music with of course with my team

0:56:15.280,0:56:20.160
i have moved to the idea of creating 
intelligent interaction with agents

0:56:20.160,0:56:26.480
with creative agents so we are moving closer 
to artificial intelligence and again quite a

0:56:26.480,0:56:33.280
number of years ago i created with colleagues 
the omax paradigm of intelligent interaction so

0:56:33.280,0:56:40.160
you see omax is really the simple idea that you 
have intelligent agent feed with ai that are able

0:56:40.160,0:56:47.520
to listen to music either in offline or in real 
time that are able simultaneously to learn so

0:56:47.520,0:56:55.280
apply a machine learning model create a model so 
a mirror of musical memory simultaneously scan and

0:56:57.040,0:57:01.760
navigate the memory in order to generate new 
materials and propose this new materials to

0:57:01.760,0:57:07.040
the musician and then you have reaction 
reactions on both sides the musician will

0:57:07.040,0:57:15.120
react to the ai the ai will react to the musician 
and we have this creative loop so omax had a lot

0:57:15.120,0:57:21.360
of hairs and descendants and you see many 
popular systems that have been derived from

0:57:21.360,0:57:28.400
or original researchers uh on the omax paradigm 
and notably all the work that is done right now at

0:57:29.360,0:57:35.520
sony music and now at spotify 
is uh that was that was um um

0:57:37.120,0:57:44.400
work done was by francois pache was immediately 
derived from our original research work at uh

0:57:45.120,0:57:51.840
on omax so homage has become a very important 
paradigm and we have moved from this paradigm to

0:57:51.840,0:57:59.840
something even more uh interesting right now but 
let me let me just give an idea of what this uh

0:57:59.840,0:58:07.280
interaction paradigm is about so before learning 
the system must listen so you must have a

0:58:07.280,0:58:14.240
perception perception aware system of listening 
we call this machine or artificial listening so

0:58:14.240,0:58:20.720
that we're gonna we're gonna uh segment uh the 
the the stream of music into uh musical in it

0:58:20.720,0:58:26.320
that that will be distribute distributed over 
some mathematical structure maybe a geometry

0:58:26.320,0:58:32.960
and we will discover with cognitive algorithm an 
alphabet symbolic alphabet structure even though

0:58:32.960,0:58:39.120
we we are dealing with audio we will discover a 
symbolic alphabet structure of on the musical unit

0:58:39.120,0:58:45.040
that will deliver a symbol extreme so from the 
symbol extreme we will learn a model so we will

0:58:45.040,0:58:50.240
use a number of machine learning algorithm and 
then regenerate and render new sequences and the

0:58:50.240,0:58:57.200
three processes listen learn and generate are real 
time and concurrent and they are both cooperative

0:59:00.800,0:59:06.800
concurrent and cooperative so the the nice 
drawing that you see here is the visual

0:59:06.800,0:59:12.160
representation of a musical sequence that has 
been learned in real time by omax and all the

0:59:12.160,0:59:18.800
colored arcs that you see are actually actually 
actually connecting different places of the music

0:59:18.800,0:59:24.560
with regard to similarity so because we have 
this co this connection created by the ai

0:59:25.680,0:59:31.600
we have a kind of cartography of a map of the 
music and the system just have to navigate around

0:59:31.600,0:59:37.360
this map to create new sequences that will be 
statistically coherent with the material that

0:59:37.360,0:59:44.480
was learned but still creative and novel so 
you see here in this model you have the the

0:59:45.200,0:59:50.240
musician who is for instance improvising and there 
is a double loop he's listening to other musicians

0:59:50.240,0:59:56.480
and but he's also he or she listening to 
uh to uh themselves and also listening to

0:59:57.200,1:00:03.120
its sound memories so himself or herself in the 
past and the memory is a virtual part because

1:00:03.120,1:00:09.200
it is constituted by all that the musician 
has played all that the other musicians are

1:00:09.200,1:00:13.280
playing and all that the mission has 
ever played or learned in his life so

1:00:13.280,1:00:19.360
this is all virtual and this is exactly the 
musical memory that the ai system is simulating

1:00:27.360,1:00:35.360
i'm hearing some music coming from somewhere 
okay okay okay so so max is like you know this

1:00:35.360,1:00:41.200
zero point here in this graph that represents two 
dimensions where you have the reactive dimension

1:00:41.200,1:00:49.760
the system reacts instantly to a to musician and 
the planning dimension where the the user can

1:00:49.760,1:00:55.840
actually plan behaviors like compose for instance 
a harmonic grid or any composition so omax is

1:00:55.840,1:01:00.720
really at zero because it is not really planning 
and it is not reactive but it has a lot of machine

1:01:00.720,1:01:06.240
learning so then we have we have developed more 
intelligent systems like the stomach system where

1:01:06.240,1:01:13.840
we have a high level of reactivity we have 
developed the important system where we have

1:01:13.840,1:01:19.280
a high level of planning and now we are working 
on a hybrid system where we would have a good

1:01:19.280,1:01:25.040
compromise between being totally reactive to what 
the live musicians are doing and also having some

1:01:25.040,1:01:32.560
planning and being able to develop interesting 
and sophisticated and structured musical processes

1:01:33.360,1:01:41.680
so here is the the general diagram the that 
we are now exploring in the rich uh project

1:01:43.200,1:01:47.600
where you have some musical input musical 
signal you have a machine listening

1:01:48.160,1:01:54.320
unit that creates a symbolic signal stream 
you have a learning unit that will do some

1:01:54.320,1:02:00.560
machine learning uh statistical probabilistic 
probabilistical or deep learning that will learn

1:02:00.560,1:02:07.680
a model and that will give back some information 
to the uh to the listening machine so it will

1:02:07.680,1:02:12.960
help the listening machine to improve itself 
so the learning will create a memory model

1:02:14.000,1:02:21.760
where we will have an interaction agent that will 
query the model in order to create new musical

1:02:21.760,1:02:28.160
material but that will still be listening to the 
musical stream in the input so the interacting

1:02:28.720,1:02:34.400
agent will be able also to be reactive and not 
only creative and generative and the user will

1:02:34.400,1:02:41.600
be able to specify scenarios so to compose some 
music but then the interacting model will be able

1:02:41.600,1:02:49.440
to give feedback control to the scenario unit in 
order to be able to generate artificial scenarios

1:02:49.440,1:02:54.160
that will be interacting with the user general 
so this is a highly sophisticated architecture

1:02:54.160,1:03:00.000
that will be able to generate very interesting 
musical experiments so now let me show you just

1:03:00.880,1:03:07.040
two two-minute video where you will see some 
example or where we have uh what we have

1:03:07.040,1:03:13.040
reached so far you will see you will see a pianist 
playing at some point you will hear three singers

1:03:13.040,1:03:17.840
edit piaf elizabeth schwarzkopf and b 
holidays who are very famous singers

1:03:17.840,1:03:24.720
so we have used audio archives but the 
ai which will totally uh re-improvise

1:03:24.720,1:03:29.840
the audio archives in order to align the 
improvisation with what the pianist is doing

1:03:54.800,1:04:11.840
and when it comes i'll do my best

1:04:31.280,1:04:39.840
oh

1:04:43.600,1:04:53.840
oh

1:05:17.920,1:05:21.840
from which i'm never wrong

1:05:34.400,1:05:35.840
oh sorry

1:05:50.240,1:06:03.840
huh

1:06:05.360,1:06:17.840
um

1:06:30.960,1:06:36.640
okay so you have seen two examples one was 
an offline example where the ai has learned

1:06:36.640,1:06:42.080
a lot of materials from the three singers and 
then is able to recompose and re-improvise

1:06:43.600,1:06:49.840
in the audio domain but as well also in 
the video domain uh the music and in the

1:06:49.840,1:06:56.400
last part of the video you have seen a real time 
example where the system captures and learned uh

1:06:57.280,1:07:04.640
his model in real time uh from what the musician 
is uh actually performing and is able to instantly

1:07:04.640,1:07:11.120
uh interact and have a dialogue with the 
musician so every time you were listening

1:07:11.120,1:07:15.680
to the saxophone sound and the musician was 
not obviously not playing his instrument

1:07:15.680,1:07:23.040
it was the ai playing and proposing a dialogue to 
the to the musician okay recently we have begun

1:07:23.040,1:07:30.480
a national research agency project called mercy 
makes musical reality with creative instruments

1:07:32.880,1:07:37.040
where we have an industrial partner 
called high vibe and high vibe has been

1:07:39.200,1:07:44.400
has obtained a lot of awards in the industrial 
world for instance there is the challenge

1:07:44.400,1:07:52.560
award of the the best uh the the best uh 
startup for uh 2021 and they are designing

1:07:52.560,1:08:00.560
a active acoustic system that uh where 
they transform material devices into uh

1:08:02.960,1:08:03.520
acoustic

1:08:06.400,1:08:10.640
diffusion system and they have created they have 
created a new instrument called the high-vibe

1:08:10.640,1:08:17.440
guitar that is equipped with actuators and sensors 
and computing power inside the guitar and when

1:08:17.440,1:08:22.960
where you can you can have some processing of 
the sound of the guitar that is rendered not by

1:08:22.960,1:08:29.280
a loudspeaker but by the body the wooden body of 
the guitar itself so it gives the the musician the

1:08:29.280,1:08:37.840
feeling that the instrument is really reacting to 
what uh he's doing so here he's here's an example

1:08:45.120,1:08:51.840
and another

1:08:54.800,1:09:02.560
so so what we want to do is to be able to embed 
the artificial intelligence into the instrument so

1:09:02.560,1:09:10.000
this instrument is not only capable of extending 
the sound of the instrumentist but also to add an

1:09:10.000,1:09:16.000
intelligent musical layer to what the musician is 
doing and maybe to co-improvise with the musician

1:09:16.000,1:09:20.960
and this is what we call co-creativity when 
we have a situation an interactive situation

1:09:20.960,1:09:26.560
where a musician and a computer system 
are able to co-create or co-improvise

1:09:26.560,1:09:29.840
and this is where we get to the 
rich project that has just begun

1:09:31.280,1:09:37.680
the last year where we are kind of uh 
wrapping up and summing up all this uh

1:09:38.400,1:09:48.560
big experience in uh writing ai system for uh 
interactive music creation uh where we want to

1:09:48.560,1:09:55.520
really really focus on what i call co-creativity 
between human and ai emphasizing that creativity

1:09:55.520,1:10:00.400
is an emerging dynamics resulting from 
complex interaction between actors so

1:10:00.400,1:10:06.320
it cannot be understood by considering each 
agent's production in separation but on the

1:10:06.320,1:10:13.040
contrary you have to consider the the really 
the uh the sum of the behaviors of the agents

1:10:13.040,1:10:20.720
so uh this frees us from the concept of artificial 
creativity art artificial intelligence in

1:10:21.840,1:10:28.080
the art because creativity is not a state that 
you are trying to reach it's a dynamical effect

1:10:28.880,1:10:34.640
an emergent effect of interaction in a complex 
system so you cannot you can never catch really

1:10:34.640,1:10:41.280
what creativity or co-creativity is in a 
static way it will only emerge in the time

1:10:41.280,1:10:47.600
of interaction this is what we the idea that we 
defined in reach so cyber human co-creativity

1:10:47.600,1:10:52.720
will appear when you have emergence of 
cohesive or contrasting joint behaviors

1:10:52.720,1:10:57.760
that that you are not able to reduce to individual 
processes and then you will have operation of

1:10:57.760,1:11:04.720
non-linear regime of event and structure formation 
that will create core evolutions of forms and

1:11:04.720,1:11:09.520
this happens because you have cross-learning 
processes where the machine learns in real time

1:11:09.520,1:11:14.080
from the musician but the musician learns in real 
time from the machine or international in general

1:11:14.080,1:11:20.400
agents that can be artificial or human 
learn from one another in a cross

1:11:22.160,1:11:26.960
way and this will create complex 
feedback loops and reinforcement

1:11:26.960,1:11:32.720
mechanism mechanism that will favor the 
the emergent the emergent mechanism so

1:11:33.920,1:11:39.040
as a cyber physical system like the guitar for 
instance is a cyber physical system they create

1:11:39.040,1:11:44.720
an interaction continuity between digital and 
physical world now we want to propose the term

1:11:44.720,1:11:50.800
cyber audience for systems that create a synergy 
between the digital models and the human mind the

1:11:50.800,1:11:59.680
human creativity so this is the the structure 
of reach but mainly what we have is two central

1:11:59.680,1:12:06.720
tasks that that are kind of converging one to the 
other one is to augment the digital agent's id

1:12:07.440,1:12:13.840
abilities with better ai algorithms enhance 
creativity autonomy sensitivity to context but

1:12:13.840,1:12:19.680
also cyber physical extension like the guitar so 
they can act in the material world on the other

1:12:19.680,1:12:27.360
side we will take the human and get it closer to 
the digital agent by augmenting the human ability

1:12:27.360,1:12:33.440
by interfacing them into embedded mixed realities 
so for instance the the creative guitar that we

1:12:33.440,1:12:39.360
are doing with iv is our first mixed reality 
instrument so something that augments the

1:12:39.360,1:12:50.880
the natural reality by a digital augmentation so 
the rich artistic impact is huge recently we had

1:12:50.880,1:12:55.920
the concert at the maison de la jolla music with 
the orchest national the the jazz and they were

1:12:55.920,1:13:01.600
playing with or algorithm that were interacting in 
real time with the whole orchestra which was which

1:13:01.600,1:13:09.680
is more than 20 musicians we have we have issued a 
a new record and a book called artistic where you

1:13:09.680,1:13:16.880
can listen to all this interact the interactive 
concert with ai and you have 200 of 200 pages of

1:13:17.440,1:13:26.160
critical analysis and commentary of the of the 
phenomenon of uh ai in uh in art a lot of concerts

1:13:26.160,1:13:34.720
festivals uh etc where all systems are actually 
uh used in in in real life and i will just show

1:13:34.720,1:13:41.040
a one minute video where you will see the same 
kind of human augmentation but here is the video

1:13:41.040,1:13:47.200
so we use the archive of binaries concert at 
the montreux jazz festival and the archives is

1:13:47.200,1:13:59.840
controlled by the ai in order that it's able to 
react in real time to what the pianist is doing

1:14:09.200,1:14:13.840
then

1:14:24.800,1:14:27.840
andy

1:14:52.720,1:14:55.840
red

1:15:21.200,1:15:24.800
so uh thank you for your 
attention and i will stop here

1:15:27.840,1:15:38.160
thank you very much and say your 
presentation is very interesting and um

1:15:38.160,1:15:44.720
i felt to tell this earlier for our 
audience if you have any questions

1:15:45.520,1:15:51.120
please post questions to the chat 
we will have a q a session or q

1:16:05.040,1:16:10.800
going to say like could you please start 
your presentation okay do you hear me

1:16:14.800,1:16:16.720
okay i think you are

1:16:18.720,1:16:28.160
seeing my screen right uh i i'm sorry uh 
you have to monitor yeah that's a problem

1:16:31.360,1:16:33.840
okay

1:16:37.120,1:16:37.760
left side

1:16:39.840,1:16:48.240
wait a minute i will activate the second screen um

1:16:48.240,1:16:54.800
maybe you can screen you can share 
not for a monitor for only a window

1:16:58.240,1:17:01.840
oh

1:17:04.640,1:17:15.840
do you see my screen no no not yet

1:17:23.600,1:17:24.800
no you don't see anything

1:17:26.880,1:17:30.560
and it's coming and maybe we 
can wait for a few seconds

1:17:33.280,1:17:43.840
sorry for that i will disconnect my second screen

1:17:53.760,1:17:57.840
i don't know what is happening

1:18:04.480,1:18:05.120
um

1:18:08.320,1:18:11.840
zoom is not really working well for me

1:18:19.760,1:18:25.840
of course okay to share a full monitor

1:18:32.960,1:18:35.200
is that okay with you do you see my screen now

1:18:38.560,1:18:42.240
did you see my screen no no no

1:18:45.200,1:18:46.720
i don't know what is going on

1:18:49.040,1:18:54.560
um i propose maybe you can send 
me your your presentation i i i

1:18:54.560,1:18:59.040
will uh yeah but i have videos so uh for me

1:19:01.760,1:19:04.480
i don't understand stop sharing

1:19:06.800,1:19:14.320
and i'm really sorry because i have to update 
my zoom and the new one is not working um

1:19:17.520,1:19:25.280
uh application windows okay maybe i can try 
that one and here do you see my side my screen

1:19:27.440,1:19:36.640
hello no no no it's black it's black yes yeah only 
black black it's black black but it's written you

1:19:36.640,1:19:49.840
start to share your screen yeah i think i have 
a problem with my display system i don't know

1:19:54.480,1:20:03.840
um i don't know what is happening

1:20:05.200,1:20:17.840
ugh

1:20:20.800,1:20:25.680
do you don't see anything you don't 
see anything telling that you are

1:20:25.680,1:20:34.560
sharing your screen but we don't see anything 
arriving on the screen actually okay let's try

1:20:45.440,1:20:46.480
i again understand

1:20:50.240,1:20:59.840
you could uh hear her monitor what is the 
first time so yeah i i this is what i'm doing

1:21:03.600,1:21:07.360
do you see something no an ear

1:21:09.600,1:21:13.840
so you don't see my monitor at all right now

1:21:16.880,1:21:18.320
i'm sorry about that

1:21:23.440,1:21:27.840
i don't see

1:21:28.720,1:21:34.800
i don't understand this usually 
should work except for this problem of

1:21:39.520,1:21:43.440
maybe you can reconnect your 
your last your second screen and

1:21:44.800,1:21:50.400
this is what i have done okay but you don't 
have to jump here you don't see anything

1:21:52.000,1:22:01.360
what if you sorry hello everybody what if you send 
your uh slides via file sender send file sender

1:22:01.920,1:22:09.840
to download and yeah but the problem is that i 
have movies uh you have too many yeah okay sorry

1:22:12.320,1:22:16.800
okay but i will maybe i can i don't 
know why why you don't see the screen

1:22:18.720,1:22:27.520
you can change the order of a presentation for 
example you can search mangalysan and marekson

1:22:29.520,1:22:31.600
then we have uh some yeah

1:22:32.960,1:22:37.840
yeah but uh this reason this will not 
solve the just sharing problem i will have

1:22:40.880,1:22:47.280
let me try something you don't see anything at all 
right now or a black screen or something like that

1:22:48.320,1:22:52.320
just a black screen

1:22:52.320,1:22:59.040
okay so i'm sorry i i don't know what uh what 
i can do there okay i can sign for sure i can't

1:22:59.040,1:23:04.640
send the presentation but uh this could be 
a pity because there are a lot of movies

1:23:04.640,1:23:11.280
uh going on um maybe i will okay you can 
switch i will try to reconnect and uh

1:23:13.120,1:23:16.000
maybe just try to disconnect and reconnect maybe

1:23:19.440,1:23:20.800
i can't try that

1:23:23.200,1:23:23.760
yeah but

1:23:26.720,1:23:33.840
new show let's try new share

1:23:36.400,1:23:42.880
let's try something else you 
still don't see anything no right

1:23:45.360,1:23:50.320
and i'm really sorry about 
that i don't know what to do um

1:23:53.280,1:24:01.840
this usually works except for this actually 
appears this morning so maybe yes we can

1:24:03.280,1:24:09.040
close a general program jim application 
then early connect to a gene

1:24:10.640,1:24:15.840
okay i will do that i will 
disconnect and reconnect again

1:24:27.520,1:24:36.560
so maybe i don't know if someone has a question 
maybe we can take one question yes it's uh

1:24:36.560,1:24:46.080
it's better to use this tank to hold qa so if 
anyone has a question to audience from audience

1:24:53.200,1:25:00.000
or culture if you have questions also to professor 
tokui and professor asaya you can ask them also

1:25:00.880,1:25:04.160
yes uh i have a question for mr tokuy

1:25:05.760,1:25:13.760
how did you create a gun for a release because 
i think it's very difficult to uh create a

1:25:13.760,1:25:25.840
discriminator for what is a light and least and 
a long reason on my song could you please share

1:25:38.720,1:25:39.840
it's very good

1:25:47.600,1:25:53.840
could you please say something

1:25:56.400,1:26:07.840
i can see your sharing monitor and sharing 
window but i cannot hear your voice

1:26:09.920,1:26:21.840
foreign

1:26:34.560,1:26:36.080
how can i can we do

1:26:44.880,1:26:49.840
yeah i'm looking forward

1:26:51.520,1:27:03.840
very strange

1:27:06.800,1:27:17.840
oh

1:27:21.840,1:27:28.320
okay do you see my screen now 
uh yes i can see okay so i will

1:27:29.200,1:27:36.400
go fast to so if possibilities so i'm jean-claire 
i'm working as a robotician so i'm not an artist

1:27:36.400,1:27:43.040
at all i'm working in a team which is called ifa 
sauce which is working basically on providing

1:27:43.040,1:27:54.480
assisted device for free people um probably that 
i don't see my screen so i cannot go up and down

1:27:57.760,1:28:05.040
okay so what are the benefits for 
scientists to work with athletes

1:28:05.040,1:28:09.360
this is the question i have to raise what are 
the benefits for artists to work with scientists

1:28:09.360,1:28:14.960
those opposite and our other application 
domains may benefit from such a collaboration

1:28:16.320,1:28:20.400
it's difficult to work with artists for a 
scientist and i assume that it's difficult

1:28:20.400,1:28:25.600
for artists to work with scientists because 
there are a lot of problems so what are

1:28:25.600,1:28:32.400
the benefits for scientists to work with 
artists well in our research institution

1:28:33.200,1:28:39.760
it's not really expected and sometimes 
it's even seen as quite suspect furthermore

1:28:40.400,1:28:46.320
from an evaluation from a scientist evaluation 
viewpoint it's difficult to evaluate because we

1:28:46.320,1:28:52.800
don't have indicators and collaboration with 
artists requires a huge understanding effort

1:28:55.280,1:29:01.920
what are the benefits for artists to work with 
scientists well it's a major difficulty is

1:29:01.920,1:29:09.840
that the scientist is some kind of in between 
between the artists and the work because them are

1:29:10.560,1:29:18.080
many of the artists are not aware of technological 
possibilities so they have an attitude of

1:29:18.080,1:29:26.480
self-censorship that limits the creativity and 
they're also the understanding effort for our

1:29:28.160,1:29:37.200
people uh they have also to understand 
scientists uh do you still hear me i'm

1:29:37.200,1:29:43.360
not sure because i have absolutely 
no sound no yeah it's okay so

1:29:44.480,1:29:51.840
let's let's go to to a practical example to show 
you that in spite of these drawbacks we have

1:29:53.440,1:29:57.200
the possibility and it's very interesting 
possibility to collaborate with artists

1:29:58.800,1:30:04.080
i will illustrate site on this example where we 
have a robot which is called the cable driven

1:30:04.080,1:30:11.200
parallel robot and the purpose of this robot is 
to be able to move the point b that you see on the

1:30:11.200,1:30:21.440
drawing the platform with this guy underside moves 
his platform in all direction x y z so we can

1:30:21.440,1:30:27.120
raise the platform go to left go 
backwards and upward and to do that

1:30:28.080,1:30:31.840
we have four cables which 
are attached to the platform

1:30:32.480,1:30:40.400
and are also attached on the winch at point a 
and the winch allowed to change the cable lengths

1:30:41.760,1:30:48.960
and by an appropriate control of the cable length 
we can change the position of the platform at will

1:30:52.160,1:30:52.660
oops

1:30:54.960,1:31:01.680
uh there is an application of this kind of robot 
in the earth's domain which is assistance to

1:31:01.680,1:31:08.080
mobility for freight people for example really 
making transfer operation helping them to go

1:31:08.080,1:31:13.600
for example to go to a sitting from a sitting 
position to a standing position and also for

1:31:13.600,1:31:18.880
working assistance with the benefits of providing 
autonomy they are able to do something that

1:31:20.320,1:31:26.720
before they were not able to do alone which 
improves self-esteem improved social relationship

1:31:27.280,1:31:33.200
and it's also very interesting for doctors 
for monitoring the health of the subject

1:31:33.200,1:31:40.240
because this platform is instrumented to give 
medical information so let's just show me a a

1:31:41.120,1:31:49.600
short video if it works i hope you can see 
the video uh you see your passion on the bed

1:31:49.600,1:31:58.560
the robot is coming down the patient is in 
a medical harness and i'm losing the job

1:31:58.560,1:32:04.400
but basically the passion can do it alone 
the robot will lift the passion to move her

1:32:05.680,1:32:14.960
in a wheelchair so she will be now again 
fully autonomous i will stop the video

1:32:17.760,1:32:24.400
but already this robot has this kind of having 
incursion of art so for example maybe you

1:32:24.400,1:32:32.080
know the pink singer and this is one of her 
public performance she moves over the crowd

1:32:33.200,1:32:39.840
using this robot and you can see 
she will do something very french

1:32:40.720,1:32:45.440
on the screen you don't see the video no video

1:32:48.000,1:32:54.720
not this one not the previous one as 
well pdf sorry but okay this is probably

1:32:54.720,1:32:59.680
the same issue with my queen i 
will skip that for the sake of time

1:33:02.800,1:33:09.680
in 2018 we have a magic encounter with 
an artist whose name is ann valerie gas

1:33:11.920,1:33:18.160
during a workshop devoted to the use of robot in 
architecture and valerie was looking for a machine

1:33:18.880,1:33:25.440
with the purpose of 3d printing a 
structure on large scale dozens of metals

1:33:26.560,1:33:28.880
the printing material is glass microbeads

1:33:30.480,1:33:36.800
the machine has to follow a fixed trajectory 
and deposit layers of glass powder but there is

1:33:36.800,1:33:42.640
no gluing element in the boiler so that the 
structure slowly collapse after each layer

1:33:44.720,1:33:49.840
and an exhibition of this structure 
was scheduled for the summer of 2019

1:33:50.480,1:33:53.040
in an art center located close to paris

1:33:55.520,1:34:01.120
we get interested in this project 
because we have made a huge

1:34:02.720,1:34:08.560
effort on the theoretical modeling and control of 
this kind of robot we are interested in long-term

1:34:08.560,1:34:15.200
deployment because this allowed to test the 
robustness of our system and especially to

1:34:15.200,1:34:21.200
detect failure understanding why something 
has failed and detecting unexpected behaviors

1:34:23.200,1:34:28.240
the objectives we have was basically increasing 
the safety and performance of the system

1:34:30.160,1:34:38.400
for dealing with uh our assistance problem 
so you see a picture of the exhibition place

1:34:38.400,1:34:45.840
it was huge uh the length was about 40 
meter so it's about 20 meter 25 meter

1:34:47.680,1:34:50.560
you see there's a drum that is moved by the robot

1:34:54.880,1:35:00.000
i will not show the video it's it's 
basically bad but i cannot do anything

1:35:00.000,1:35:13.840
to get that also maybe i try maybe let me 
try something uh i hope i will not lose

1:35:20.320,1:35:27.840
maybe you switch the video now

1:35:33.360,1:35:41.840
i can see the video okay

1:35:47.120,1:35:55.840
and now it's deploying the powder on the structure

1:35:57.760,1:36:06.400
okay we'll stop the video move back to the 
talk i hope you see the the slide now um

1:36:08.080,1:36:14.960
so some result of this exhibition the exhibition 
lasts for one month and a half the robot traveled

1:36:14.960,1:36:24.320
for more than four kilometers walking in 
average four hours and fifteen minutes per day

1:36:24.320,1:36:31.120
uh 76 layers of glass powder were deposited 
which represents 1.5 tons of glass

1:36:31.920,1:36:36.480
and we have some failures one cable 
breakdown during the installation

1:36:37.520,1:36:44.480
and two small failure encoder on one axis 
model but so was it was not really important

1:36:46.800,1:36:54.080
uh next we move to icra 2020 the same uh 
exhibition was scheduled to be part of

1:36:54.080,1:36:59.920
uh the exhibition part of a big 
robotics conference which is

1:36:59.920,1:37:06.960
whose name is aikra which uh have 5000 
plus atlantis in paris during june 2020

1:37:07.760,1:37:13.360
we have improved the system but unfortunately 
iqra was postponed because of the coffee

1:37:14.480,1:37:20.080
and our new exhibition will take place during the 
summer of this year in a museum close to to this

1:37:22.240,1:37:32.400
lesson learned from art to science we have 
received a huge benefit in taking part of the

1:37:32.400,1:37:39.680
exhibition from a scientific viewpoint we are a 
single team in a world which is able to master a

1:37:39.680,1:37:46.160
very difficult issue in this kind of robots 
furthermore this experiment those are very

1:37:47.200,1:37:50.880
unique test bed for researchers 
working on new information

1:37:50.880,1:37:57.600
dunes formation modeling but still many of the 
colleagues our research school indicates that

1:37:59.360,1:38:04.160
more or less valley yeah could 
you please back to the pdf

1:38:06.240,1:38:16.240
too we see the stop the video so 
could you please back to pdf okay um

1:38:19.200,1:38:29.840
let me see

1:38:30.640,1:38:37.600
okay now you sh okay you schematic 
so i'm backing up lesson learned um

1:38:38.240,1:38:41.440
from a scientific viewpoint this 
experiment was very interesting

1:38:42.080,1:38:49.920
but still many of our research colleagues states 
more or less overly that this is not real science

1:38:55.040,1:39:01.040
it's also said that the government's 
level that interdisciplinarity is

1:39:02.320,1:39:08.880
very good is a necessity but in the practice 
of such official speech is quite different

1:39:10.800,1:39:14.640
because the evaluation committee are not 
very comfortable with such a collaboration

1:39:17.440,1:39:24.160
uh what we need also is that discussion with 
doctors and artists have a lot of similarity they

1:39:24.160,1:39:29.600
have a different language they have a different 
level of scientific knowledge but for us it's

1:39:29.600,1:39:35.680
quite uh interesting because this exhibition 
has facilitated our communication with doctors

1:39:37.200,1:39:41.840
now lesson learned from science to 
art many artists believes that that

1:39:41.840,1:39:46.960
animating an artwork is a complex and 
expensive task this is no more true

1:39:49.120,1:39:52.080
even for motion except for very large artwork

1:39:53.200,1:40:03.360
uh to illustrate that in 2015 we have uh organized 
a workshop called computer science for art which

1:40:03.360,1:40:08.640
results so it was a five day workshop which 
resulted in a concept at the end of the workshop

1:40:09.280,1:40:14.880
with the device developed by the artist during 
the workshop and i can show you a picture of

1:40:14.880,1:40:22.640
this concept you see some strange machines that 
were making music both on the ground on the table

1:40:23.360,1:40:31.520
you see a dancer uh for example the dancer as an 
accelerometer on so that the music was changing

1:40:31.520,1:40:38.880
according to a motion so i moved to conclusion 
and sorry for the delay uh for a scientist

1:40:38.880,1:40:44.720
wondering on domains quite different from our 
main research field is very fruitful this allows

1:40:44.720,1:40:51.600
us to develop new algorithms new software newer 
methodologies and all this work may be used for

1:40:52.720,1:41:00.320
other research topics in our case working with 
artists has allowed us to improve our medical

1:41:00.320,1:41:07.440
device facilitate our discussion with doctors 
but also to better understand human accepta

1:41:07.440,1:41:14.880
acceptation of the device which is quite essential 
for us and to better understand the pasture needs

1:41:15.600,1:41:22.480
so this will end up my presentation and sorry for 
the technical problem thank you for your attention

1:41:25.360,1:41:27.520
thank you very much for uh

1:41:30.080,1:41:41.200
i understand this uh conclusion very much uh so 
this time uh this is the end of a session one and

1:41:41.200,1:41:50.880
uh from now uh we'd like to have some accurate 
session so if any and anyone has a question

1:41:50.880,1:42:00.800
for the speakers could you please raise your 
hand or say something from my microphone

1:42:03.280,1:42:03.780
hello

1:42:06.080,1:42:13.840
chris as i said

1:42:19.120,1:42:27.840
no

1:42:28.880,1:42:32.480
maybe you started a question 
uh quick you know maybe you can

1:42:33.600,1:42:41.040
yes i have so many questions uh sensei uh 
i'm very impressed by your presentation

1:42:43.680,1:42:54.400
is very good to improve advance the possibility of 
music so i'm very impressed by your work how can i

1:42:54.400,1:43:07.440
say the guitar with a vibration so how what is the 
initial motivation of to create this kind of data

1:43:09.520,1:43:18.560
okay so uh as i said one of the 
fundamentals of the rich project is to

1:43:19.520,1:43:29.840
state that creativity shared with the machine 
can only be an emergent process that will

1:43:30.480,1:43:40.480
that will appear in in the course of interaction 
and uh so so that you cannot really uh

1:43:41.680,1:43:47.920
describe what is creativity for a machine 
and maybe this this doesn't have even

1:43:47.920,1:43:54.560
meaning but you can describe creative or 
co-creative processes that are emerging

1:43:54.560,1:44:00.000
because you have a complex interaction 
between agents artificial or humans who are

1:44:01.280,1:44:05.760
related by a cross-learning 
phenomenon so once we have uh

1:44:05.760,1:44:12.240
moved into this realm we have realized that in 
order to really have this convergence between

1:44:13.200,1:44:19.280
cyber augmentation which is augmenting the 
the the capacities of agaris of algorithms

1:44:19.280,1:44:24.640
and human augmentation which is augmenting 
the capacities of human towards the algorithm

1:44:25.360,1:44:33.840
we needed we really needed a physical step that 
is a step where there would be some embodiment of

1:44:33.840,1:44:40.640
the human into the process of interacting with 
the machine so the guitar is only the first uh

1:44:40.640,1:44:48.960
try that we make the first step of of trying to 
to to create the condition for such a physical

1:44:48.960,1:44:56.640
embodiment of the human by embedding the algorithm 
into a physical device that the human really has

1:44:56.640,1:45:02.160
against his body and feels like an extension 
of the of his body but it is just the first

1:45:02.160,1:45:08.080
experiment of course we would like to design many 
other instruments or any kind of devices where

1:45:09.120,1:45:15.200
this emergence of co-creativity between human and 
machines will be really the result not only of an

1:45:15.200,1:45:20.400
intellectual process but of a physical embodiment 
of the human and maybe and maybe sometimes because

1:45:20.400,1:45:27.840
we we had a robotics presentation just before and 
maybe also a physical embodiment of artificial

1:45:27.840,1:45:35.120
creators too thank you very much i'm very 
impressed by your idea co-creativity with machine

1:45:36.080,1:45:46.160
and then i one question to mr tokui and i already 
asked the question so could you please answer it

1:45:47.680,1:45:57.120
so how can that how i train my gun model 
on listen that was question correct okay

1:45:57.120,1:46:08.560
so maybe i was not so clear about my project 
so the first step was uh to train a normal gun

1:46:08.560,1:46:17.360
model a generative otherwise a network model on 
this data so it's i think relatively easy for

1:46:18.480,1:46:28.480
you know gans network to capture the the essence 
of within pattern but i think i thought it's just

1:46:29.920,1:46:41.280
another imitation of human creativity in a way 
that's why as a second step uh i added another

1:46:41.280,1:46:51.120
discriminator to the original gun framework 
then the second discriminator is not is not

1:46:53.200,1:46:59.680
expected to classify uh training data from uh uh

1:47:02.960,1:47:13.520
at least artificial data but it's expected 
to classify the genre of music generated

1:47:16.080,1:47:16.580
so

1:47:19.440,1:47:26.320
the original uh discriminator 
was uh trained to classify

1:47:28.560,1:47:37.440
the real data from the situation right that's the 
uh the core concept when it was about a network

1:47:37.440,1:47:46.240
then i added a second discriminator which 
does the classification of musical genres

1:47:48.880,1:47:59.440
so the origin uh that's right the the generator 
was uh uh trained to confuse not only the original

1:47:59.440,1:48:07.520
uh discriminator but also the second gen 
classification discriminator so i expect

1:48:09.280,1:48:20.000
at the end generator will be able to generate 
something that sounds like a realism pattern but

1:48:21.520,1:48:31.840
uh this is patterns that 
don't belong to any genres

1:48:43.200,1:48:54.000
the original idea was when you think about artists 
maybe uh so think about uh any famous ladies

1:48:54.720,1:49:13.840
picasso for example so he started to uh you 
know uh trying himself to uh capture the the um

1:49:15.520,1:49:21.840
let me rephrase again uh so picasso 
or any other artist should start

1:49:22.880,1:49:29.680
painting uh to imitate somebody 
else's style right so i want to be

1:49:29.680,1:49:41.760
like this artist or that artist but uh because 
or any other artist at some point they start uh

1:49:43.600,1:49:52.640
try to deviate from the existing 
styles so there is some kind of uh

1:49:54.400,1:50:03.200
like uh i can say uh the conflict between 
like staying in the existing style

1:50:04.640,1:50:11.520
and also like deviating from the existing 
style so there is very delicate balance between

1:50:12.640,1:50:23.840
these two directions so i wanted to make 
realize that conflict within the gown framework

1:50:24.400,1:50:31.520
yeah i understand okay uh you mean that uh 
all artists have uh their own discriminator

1:50:32.080,1:50:39.680
in their own the one is to imitate another 
dish and another discriminator is to

1:50:39.680,1:50:51.840
escape from the uh traditional uh at art so i 
understand that it's very interesting and it works

1:50:56.240,1:51:01.520
can you hear me i have a question 
for your presentation and

1:51:04.000,1:51:12.240
i understand that you are a scientist and 
uh have collaborated with us artists so

1:51:13.440,1:51:17.040
is there any a point that the important point

1:51:17.600,1:51:25.360
uh to corrupt suspect successful collaboration 
with artists artists what is the point

1:51:29.120,1:51:29.620
yeah

1:51:31.680,1:51:40.320
this is we have to adopt a very different 
different uh mind when working with artists

1:51:40.880,1:51:49.440
compared to other work we may do with companies 
and stuff like that for two reasons uh because

1:51:49.440,1:51:57.040
they have the main for many reasons in fact 
they have a different language and we have

1:51:57.040,1:52:03.840
a different language so we have to understand 
each other sometimes we use the same word but

1:52:03.840,1:52:11.040
with different meaning so that we need to create 
some kind of dictionary between the two community

1:52:13.200,1:52:20.240
then the artists are not always aware of all 
of our technological and scientific constraints

1:52:22.480,1:52:28.080
well what is really uh make me 
afraid some in some time is that

1:52:29.280,1:52:38.080
when artists tell me oh i have just a minor 
detail to change the system the last time they

1:52:38.080,1:52:43.040
the artists tell us because we work with many 
different artists but the one we are working

1:52:43.040,1:52:50.320
with right now the last time she tell me that 
results in 400 hours of work changing everything

1:52:51.280,1:53:01.360
uh but it's okay uh at the same time we really 
learn from the way people are seeing our work

1:53:03.680,1:53:09.360
the view of the artist is very different from 
the view we have and it's very close to what the

1:53:09.360,1:53:14.240
passion tells so it's very important to have this 
discussion with us because it's opened our mind

1:53:17.840,1:53:28.000
thank you very much wonderful episode and thank 
you for all and then we'd like to have some uh

1:53:32.000,1:53:32.500
uh

1:53:35.120,1:53:43.440
can you read the chat screen magazine 
has a question who to uh to question

1:53:46.240,1:53:52.240
sharing the same point of view uh which are the 
ownership i see and this is not question hashing

1:53:53.280,1:54:04.000
then i'd like to have a coffee break to uh for 
now and we can see the uh screen of a video

1:54:04.000,1:54:13.040
from arya material and you can see the 
video from i took in this state in europe

1:54:17.200,1:54:21.840
with a cup of coffee

1:54:32.240,1:54:35.840
is

1:54:46.000,1:54:49.840
foreign

1:55:10.400,1:55:17.840
the machine

1:55:31.360,1:55:31.860
foreign

1:56:02.080,1:56:13.840
foreign

1:56:55.520,1:56:56.020
okay

1:57:46.400,1:57:51.840
foreign

1:58:09.520,1:58:19.840
is

1:58:58.480,1:59:06.800
five years ago i saw some small demonstrations 
of it doing like really expressive remapping

1:59:06.800,1:59:15.040
from like gesture drawing to something somewhat 
photographic i thought that that was an amazing

1:59:15.040,1:59:22.160
way to encapsulate knowledge of the figure is 
in a neural network i can see a lot of the same

1:59:22.160,1:59:28.960
challenges that the neural network will try to 
understand that an artist tries to understand

1:59:28.960,1:59:38.400
the artist controls it from his imagination and 
his ideas and then he kind of confers the routine

1:59:41.760,1:59:44.960
that's what i discovered that i was able to do

1:59:44.960,1:59:51.280
with the ai at a university i did arts 
but engineering was my primary degree

1:59:52.640,2:00:00.320
my work is somewhat of the understanding from 
engineering and then my artistic study as well

2:00:03.680,2:00:07.120
and so a lot of my photography 
initially was to support

2:00:07.120,2:00:11.360
my my own understanding but 
also the anatomy lectures

2:00:16.880,2:00:22.960
and that's usually how the the project starts 
with kind of a concept that i visualize in

2:00:22.960,2:00:29.840
my imagination and then i try to see if 
it fits within the techniques that i've

2:00:29.840,2:00:35.920
explored whether it was possible i guess one 
of the reasons why maybe my stuff is different

2:00:36.800,2:00:43.680
i try really ridiculous ideas just to see how 
interestingly they fail that part of the process

2:00:43.680,2:00:51.920
is maybe a scientist or a researcher but even as 
an artist the failure is sometimes beautiful i

2:00:51.920,2:01:07.840
understand the boundaries of what machine learning 
can do and then just test it and see what happens

2:02:32.320,2:02:45.840
hello

2:03:13.520,2:03:16.000
from japan uh his name is akira

2:03:16.880,2:03:23.120
just approached the idea of creating characters 
because he worked for me was like really

2:03:24.000,2:03:34.400
mind-blowing i decided to uh to find my my way 
as well i'm trying to convince myself to finish

2:03:35.120,2:03:43.440
so what i want to do is like a massive 
project i would say like 10 000 different

2:03:45.520,2:03:50.160
creatures the tools allow 
me to work on at this scale

2:03:50.160,2:03:55.840
and i want to try to see what comes out of it

2:04:08.400,2:04:09.840
oh

2:04:50.080,2:04:51.840
oh

2:04:58.880,2:05:05.840
yes

2:05:09.840,2:05:19.840
hello

2:05:30.960,2:05:33.840
something

2:05:34.800,2:05:47.840
yep

2:05:52.800,2:06:01.840
yes

2:06:14.160,2:06:15.840
yes

2:06:30.960,2:06:43.840
e

2:06:55.440,2:06:57.840
uh

2:07:53.760,2:07:54.260
we

2:08:44.800,2:08:49.840
foreign

2:09:06.720,2:09:10.320
okay uh thank you very much

2:09:12.560,2:09:20.720
so i'd like to restart the session 
from now we'd like to start session two

2:09:22.800,2:09:31.840
after first the first presentator is professor 
lionel obadiar from university of lyon 2.

2:09:32.800,2:09:36.960
what do you say thank you very 
much for attending this simple gym

2:09:38.320,2:09:44.720
could you please start your presentation 
i'm trying you hear me yes i can hear you

2:09:44.720,2:09:49.840
all right fine i don't have videos and i hope 
everything will feel right for my presentation

2:09:49.840,2:09:57.440
oh and i'm really happy and to be there thanks 
for the invitation i see that there are a couple

2:09:57.440,2:10:03.920
of people that i know around the table but it is 
another story so i share my presentation right now

2:10:06.160,2:10:06.660
and

2:10:09.440,2:10:18.080
i can see can you see it yes all right let's 
go for it um i'm just trying to have this um

2:10:19.040,2:10:27.280
uh well well well i'm sharing but i want to have 
this okay i'm going like that okay do you see

2:10:27.280,2:10:35.520
just one one slide okay perfect okay great uh 
this is a very long title um and a very short

2:10:35.520,2:10:41.680
reflection that you will see and uh i'm a social 
and cultural anthropology specialized in religion

2:10:41.680,2:10:48.800
asian religion to be a clear and i've recently 
since years a couple of years i'm converting

2:10:48.800,2:10:57.360
myself to the state anthropological study of 
digital technologies aaa robotics and and so on

2:10:58.000,2:11:07.920
so um just one point if i have a problem for 
the presentation since i do not see all right

2:11:07.920,2:11:16.800
i do not see my screen name yeah um so a couple of 
reflections starting from fieldwork that i've been

2:11:16.800,2:11:26.800
conducting season since one two years ago i tried 
to submit an erc advance but uh unfortunately and

2:11:26.800,2:11:31.600
they contrary to other colleagues around the table 
it was not successful this time that it will be

2:11:31.600,2:11:37.680
resubmitted this year but digital magic and i'm 
quite glad to hear that uh professor merely talk

2:11:37.680,2:11:42.560
about magic but in in the context of robotics 
this is exactly what i'm trying to explore now

2:11:43.280,2:11:50.800
um so i will talk about today uh um humans 
and the the tendency and the and the trends

2:11:50.800,2:11:59.600
in in robotics uh and in war society to consider 
that robots and all these kind of 3d aaa forms uh

2:12:00.240,2:12:07.680
have to be human shaped and what kind of cultural 
imagination it brings at the forefront of the

2:12:07.680,2:12:12.880
agenda of a reflection of technology and culture 
technology and society and technology and history

2:12:13.520,2:12:20.720
so we all know that the digital revolution impacts 
uh coming in there a wide range of form and effect

2:12:20.720,2:12:26.000
in now uh we all agree that we live in 
networked connected world and society

2:12:26.000,2:12:32.160
and interaction with these devices small ones 
big ones have become natural and natural means

2:12:32.880,2:12:41.680
in our lexicon culturally accepted so we are many 
now studying these new attitudes representation

2:12:41.680,2:12:48.160
and cultural frameworks and imagination that 
give means to technology as they infused society

2:12:48.160,2:12:53.440
and daily lives and there is this kind 
of interaction in between technologies

2:12:53.440,2:12:59.120
and culture and society complete and and 
ongoing uh feedback in between the twos

2:13:00.080,2:13:05.600
my anthropological point of view um it's 
culturally focused it's comparative and

2:13:05.600,2:13:12.000
i'm conducting ethnography of labs exhibitions 
enterprises university everywhere where i can

2:13:12.000,2:13:19.040
find people that are trying to design develop 
test use and socially distribute these very

2:13:19.040,2:13:24.240
strange devices called aaa and robots so i'm in 
the second month i'm professor an entrepreneur at

2:13:24.240,2:13:28.800
the university of lyon but i'm in the second 
month right now in two labs the first one is

2:13:30.880,2:13:37.040
center for the study of internet and society so 
this is all about um communication device and

2:13:37.040,2:13:43.440
the sharing information and so on and i'm 
also associated a member of the institute

2:13:43.440,2:13:48.720
the systematic religion of the robotic institute 
for intelligent system and robotics where i'm

2:13:48.720,2:13:56.480
conducting my field work and among other places 
where i'm doing this field works and my paper will

2:13:56.480,2:14:02.480
emphasize images and belief through attitudes 
children expression and cultural expression

2:14:02.480,2:14:09.840
thing at large including artistic one but i will 
not talk about hearts in this presentation today

2:14:09.840,2:14:15.840
this course on robots especially robots rather 
than a and other digital device this focus is

2:14:15.840,2:14:24.240
mainly due to the fact that robots and indeed 
raise the crucial issue of human shape form of

2:14:24.240,2:14:34.480
uh technological creations so this paper is not on 
art except that i'm participating on a uh ongoing

2:14:34.480,2:14:41.040
research with people that who are working on 
heart this is a seminar untitled robots on stage

2:14:41.040,2:14:45.760
interdisciplinary conversions between robotic and 
theater this is a network and people are working

2:14:45.760,2:14:52.160
together you can see an image of what they do they 
are studying plays and robots in place and aaa in

2:14:52.160,2:15:00.240
plays and and this is one of the place that i've 
been studying and presented in this network but

2:15:00.240,2:15:08.480
my focus will be on arts let's say popular arts 
the movies literature and online these robots a.m

2:15:09.120,2:15:15.200
and other so-called creators as seen from the 
side of social sciences and humanities means

2:15:15.200,2:15:23.920
not users but designers to users on the human side 
and the empirical studies demonstrate that um we

2:15:23.920,2:15:29.360
have the evidence that a is everywhere but still 
it is nowhere because sometimes with the lack of

2:15:29.360,2:15:38.080
materiality and the previous uh papers underscore 
this point that we have to materialize and the um

2:15:38.960,2:15:46.000
it was on your own paper uh put emphasis on 
the materialization and visualization of these

2:15:46.000,2:15:51.280
of these devices and software so it depends on 
the perception of their silence and materiality

2:15:51.920,2:15:58.000
and the same for the degree of reality of the 
integration of this device in our life unless

2:15:58.000,2:16:03.920
i left beside the issue of cultural difference 
in between foundations japan and france and the

2:16:03.920,2:16:12.560
united states and so on and um countries with a 
lower economic development for instance where the

2:16:12.560,2:16:19.200
issue of this technology is an issue of cultural 
framework by which this technology are understood

2:16:19.760,2:16:26.320
is raised in a quite different way but we'll talk 
about culture and society in general excuse for

2:16:26.320,2:16:34.400
the very very fast generalization then this is 
important to take into account that there are the

2:16:35.120,2:16:41.760
inequal social and cultural distribution of device 
and their availabilities skills and knowledge and

2:16:41.760,2:16:48.080
i heard uh several times this morning the issue 
of failures the issue of not understanding the

2:16:48.080,2:16:54.000
issue of something that's something wrong in the 
in the behavior of the machines and still this is

2:16:54.000,2:16:59.359
really important to understand oh as well what 
humans provide as meanings and especially when

2:16:59.359,2:17:07.599
it's about non-rational means um again these 
robots aa software and algorithm and so on

2:17:07.600,2:17:13.280
uh uh distributed on a different scale they are 
very small one that i that is hidden for instance

2:17:13.280,2:17:20.160
in in a in a smartphone application and other ones 
that take the shape of a big robot that you can

2:17:20.160,2:17:27.840
face you can have a face-to-face interaction 
then one thing is striking is the fact that um

2:17:28.560,2:17:34.399
not most not all but a significant 
part of these devices are shaped

2:17:34.399,2:17:41.679
against the uh human face or human shaped or 
human body shape um and it raised the question

2:17:41.680,2:17:47.600
uh how are we trying to make new humans or 
are they still machines and it raised the

2:17:47.600,2:17:55.840
outcomes of the issue of mimesis in between 
humans and machine on both sides for instance

2:17:56.800,2:18:02.399
besides um the issue that social sciences 
and humanities are trying to raise and

2:18:02.399,2:18:09.280
trying to explore is the interaction in 
between these humans and devices and the

2:18:09.280,2:18:15.439
correspondence in between human to human social 
relationship and human device relationships and

2:18:15.439,2:18:21.919
in reality only in imagination and this is 
a war scenario for science fiction movies uh

2:18:22.720,2:18:27.520
machines to machine communication against human 
that you know that this is a really this topic

2:18:28.080,2:18:33.920
and a quite widespread scenario of 
robots against humans this is one of the

2:18:34.880,2:18:45.680
most used uh let's say a background by which we we 
imagine uh the the future in movies especially in

2:18:46.720,2:18:52.800
in in famous north americans so 
we have different side different

2:18:52.800,2:18:57.680
forms of materiality from flat devices 
screen that are everywhere on 3d devices

2:18:58.319,2:19:05.679
robots for instance and 3d that can be real if you 
see a machine acting that's why fights on the uh

2:19:06.399,2:19:13.200
professor merely as demonstrated but also 
uh you can see also 3d uh device this is a

2:19:13.200,2:19:18.399
3d representation but what's new uh as an 
anthropologist i'm interested in the fact

2:19:18.399,2:19:23.839
that they are continuities and rupture in the 
relationships in between humans and material

2:19:23.840,2:19:30.560
environment through techniques and um i'm 
quite fond of this theory that imagine that

2:19:30.560,2:19:36.960
there is kind of a ongoing relationship to 
uh materiality and to things that we shape

2:19:38.080,2:19:43.280
so humans seems to have always been 
interested in mediating their relationship to

2:19:43.280,2:19:49.439
reality thanks to technology at large start 
with very very primitive technologies and it

2:19:49.439,2:19:55.759
end up in hyper modern and quick massive wave of 
all these devices that are colonizing our life

2:19:55.760,2:20:01.760
robots conversational agent algorithm software 
robots connected objects and so on for many

2:20:01.760,2:20:07.440
different purposes domestic military education 
artistic purpose for instance aid generated

2:20:08.080,2:20:15.120
by arts or a as inspiration for artists as a 
representation then we live in this new ecosystem

2:20:15.120,2:20:23.840
of so-called anthropology significant other are 
mediated so the anthropological outlook on this

2:20:24.479,2:20:31.359
is that if we raise issues regarding our 
relationship to a technological device and

2:20:31.359,2:20:39.519
robots for instance there are already topics like 
ethics and trust this has been already treated and

2:20:40.160,2:20:45.840
discussed by psychology philosophy and law but ssh 
can bring like a lot of dimension taste and proof

2:20:46.399,2:20:53.920
uh from the appeal to robots and and aaa and the 
belief in these devices are animating by something

2:20:54.880,2:21:00.400
and then anthropology sorry for uh insisting 
on this point but uh want to highlight

2:21:01.120,2:21:08.080
how humans are in practice creative with machine 
and how also they inject imagination futuristic

2:21:08.080,2:21:14.960
scenario and even present scenario and how the 
scenario infused society and my interest raised in

2:21:14.960,2:21:22.000
the fact that this scenario also impacts different 
sectors society including technological ones

2:21:22.000,2:21:29.040
means that the people that are building these 
technologies are actors like uh all all other

2:21:29.040,2:21:36.080
actors and they are um influence uh from the best 
for the worst influenced by this imaginary frames

2:21:36.640,2:21:41.440
and then i will focus on image and imagination 
through these screens and visual culture

2:21:42.720,2:21:48.960
but let's start for the beginning and 
these new mechanics automats robots

2:21:49.920,2:21:55.200
located according to the frame of imagination 
at the frontiers between humanity and the

2:21:55.200,2:22:01.760
rationality between fiction and realism and 
especially human human with robots that capture

2:22:01.760,2:22:10.000
maybe most maybe more than even all the other ones 
um this kind of imagination and then there is an

2:22:10.000,2:22:16.399
interesting discussion in robotics right now uh 
the um tracing back to meteorological routes this

2:22:16.399,2:22:24.000
is a widespread tendency and there are two trends 
that if you as an anthropologist read literature

2:22:24.000,2:22:30.880
in robotics not not very technical but more open 
to history and culture and you see that there are

2:22:30.880,2:22:39.359
um sub-community of roboticians that think that 
uh ar robots are in rupture with ancient ancient

2:22:39.359,2:22:44.639
forms means that it used to be some kind of 
representation and either human shape the

2:22:45.359,2:22:52.559
things uh quasi human for instance talos that 
you see that has been built by ephrais and the

2:22:52.560,2:22:59.600
feistos have already been mentioned uh today not 
not the program but the the ancient uh greek code

2:22:59.600,2:23:06.479
and uh other ones that think that air and robots 
are only the continuity of an ongoing mythological

2:23:06.479,2:23:15.040
mental scheme in the human brain and these 
continuity can be seen as well in what is called

2:23:15.040,2:23:22.399
now the animistic design of new technologies 
and the idea that there is something inside

2:23:22.399,2:23:29.280
something that is hunting the technology something 
like a soul or something that does it above or

2:23:29.280,2:23:37.679
beyond um the rationality and the purely mechanic 
uh life of things and this even turns to a

2:23:38.319,2:23:44.240
modern religious robot i take two examples here 
and one in china and one in the west these are

2:23:45.120,2:23:51.200
robot priest and in some context even the 
religious system clearly accept the presence

2:23:51.200,2:23:59.359
of robots but as vehicles of belief and one 
thing is really important is that we are

2:23:59.359,2:24:06.719
witnessing something really really different now 
it's a belief in robots and they believe in a as

2:24:06.720,2:24:13.680
religious schemes as as a religious object 
and to mention the rise of the thanks to uh

2:24:13.680,2:24:19.680
because of lewandowski i used to be a an 
engineer at google the first church of

2:24:19.680,2:24:28.400
aaa that considered that air is a godlike create 
but these robots and i focus here only on robots

2:24:30.800,2:24:36.000
it comes under a vast array of types and 
prototypes you can have small parts of

2:24:36.000,2:24:45.040
the body and you can have the full human humanoid 
body and this is thanks to uh uh also a clear and

2:24:45.040,2:24:52.479
quick advance in uh personal robotics in biomimi's 
sensor elaboration algorithm-inspired emotions and

2:24:52.479,2:25:00.399
and so on that makes some of the uh organizations 
and enterprises creating robots uh attempting to

2:25:00.399,2:25:06.160
create robots more and more resembling to 
human bodies and if you allow me a slogan

2:25:06.160,2:25:12.960
because anthropologists like to produce slogan 
we shifting from bios the system setup to buy us

2:25:12.960,2:25:20.000
life within these robots and uh this is a 
kind of witnessing or revealing unveiling

2:25:20.000,2:25:25.680
this obsession for anthropomorphism and and 
one thing is surprising striking is even the uh

2:25:25.680,2:25:32.800
representation of aa as a software the flat device 
is entropromorphized as you can see on the on the

2:25:33.439,2:25:38.960
on the small picture on the right uh because 
of intelligence and intelligence it's supposed

2:25:38.960,2:25:45.439
to be in the brain uh but there are also other 
other theories about intelligence uh anyway um

2:25:46.319,2:25:54.240
all this brings us to the idea that we start from 
and end up in the representation of human body

2:25:54.800,2:26:00.160
and then these new programs in human centered 
a.a and robotics tend to respond or seem to

2:26:00.160,2:26:06.160
respond to this human tendency to consider 
technology as a replication of living real

2:26:06.160,2:26:14.639
real hard actions but these humans are flat 
or 3d almost human or meta human and so on um

2:26:16.319,2:26:23.519
range among very different uh 
forms and only the adjective

2:26:24.319,2:26:30.160
seems to validate and you keep the human 
substantive noon and you take a lot of

2:26:32.000,2:26:38.160
they inspire a lot of adjectives depending 
on what you mean and there are at least three

2:26:38.160,2:26:43.680
epistemological regimes that you can raise 
after this adjective for instance they said

2:26:43.680,2:26:49.520
like humans almost humans are meta-humans 
if you consider that these humans resemble

2:26:50.319,2:26:56.399
humans only if they are almost human that they 
tend to be human that they will be one day

2:26:56.399,2:27:06.080
as human or just like human and the meta humans 
is they are supposed to be above humans and in my

2:27:06.080,2:27:14.399
research i'm conducting a interesting experience 
in which i i ask people to react in faith in

2:27:14.399,2:27:20.399
front of all these meta humans for instance you 
see that on my screen this is on the left but

2:27:20.399,2:27:25.599
on your screen it may be on the right this is 
this they are quite handsome lady this but this

2:27:25.600,2:27:33.201
person does not exist because it's a a generated 
face and also there are um these double humans

2:27:34.000,2:27:39.120
for instance this character of star wars that 
was his towers one and died in the meantime

2:27:39.120,2:27:45.760
and was recreated through aa techniques 
to incarnate a new character in recent uh

2:27:46.560,2:27:51.359
star wars movie even if he's dead but he has the 
same face he has the same movement and of course

2:27:51.359,2:27:59.599
he has the same voice and the uh digital human 
experience it's also interesting because it's a

2:27:59.600,2:28:07.760
conversation conversational agent with uh um face 
attitudes so you feel like you are talking with

2:28:07.760,2:28:15.440
something that is almost human not really human 
it's in between and creating a very very strange

2:28:16.399,2:28:23.759
um different ways to uh being human race of 
course a series of questions and i'm trying to

2:28:24.319,2:28:30.080
frame them after um different questions 
and different theoretical patterns to uh to

2:28:31.920,2:28:38.399
put concept on them uh first the issue that 
has been raised previously or as well the

2:28:38.399,2:28:47.519
acceptance of these virtual humans uh we 
i'm talking in front of people from japan

2:28:47.520,2:28:54.400
so mori's famous uncanny valley is still a 
concept that will still discuss but was just

2:28:55.680,2:29:02.640
a very specific step in the perception and 
interaction with a very specific type of of

2:29:02.640,2:29:09.439
machine and robot but the uncanny valley has been 
widespread in the meantime and now this is a huge

2:29:09.439,2:29:16.799
concept that we can uh manipulate and redefine in 
order to understand what what's the thrill that

2:29:16.800,2:29:21.920
you have when you meet these non-humans but 
they are also human they are in between and

2:29:21.920,2:29:29.520
this is uh the open door to uh understanding the 
very magical uh thinking uh that is in between

2:29:30.399,2:29:36.479
humans and mesh so these devices assume different 
forms they are co-operative functional therapeutic

2:29:36.479,2:29:42.479
friendly assistive and so on and they create a 
vast array of emotion as well but these emotions

2:29:42.479,2:29:48.559
are mixed together they create anxiety fear for 
instance people are really afraid of robots thanks

2:29:48.560,2:29:55.040
are due to science fiction movies or literature 
but also because they are across the road of of

2:29:55.760,2:30:02.800
of robots and uh but this is not always the case 
most of the of the time the people have fun with

2:30:02.800,2:30:07.359
robots and there and to a certain extent 
and a very specific context they also feel

2:30:07.359,2:30:13.200
empathy and love and sense of security but uh i'm 
talking about this therapeutic robot's name paul

2:30:14.000,2:30:22.240
which is made for all people with a psychiatric 
psychological trouble and then um they are

2:30:23.600,2:30:30.319
something that is coming in between what i call 
the three t but uh this isn't that time and if it

2:30:30.319,2:30:36.880
doesn't work uh please tell me and please create a 
space for discussion in order to contradict these

2:30:37.600,2:30:44.399
these um these atoms to uh theorize uh the human 
to robots relationships the tools of this robot

2:30:44.399,2:30:49.920
are first tools but they are also toys we are 
playing with these devices and coming back to

2:30:49.920,2:30:56.080
this in in a second and they are also conditions 
i mean temptation because we create something more

2:30:56.080,2:31:01.920
than a relationship we get also emotions and 
we are committed to this device for instance

2:31:01.920,2:31:08.399
uh this kind of uh obsession with this device 
up to uh sexual desires because now we are

2:31:08.960,2:31:14.960
witnessing the rise of sexual robots and not only 
in asian countries but also in europe and north

2:31:14.960,2:31:22.960
america and then i think that and this may be also 
a certain way to get closer to the artistic milieu

2:31:23.760,2:31:29.600
thinking about play play in three different 
terms of three different definitions of the terms

2:31:29.600,2:31:34.640
first is playing with reality we are in a game 
and there is something happening that we know

2:31:34.640,2:31:41.120
this is not exactly reality but we are trying 
to play with reality and the second is to play

2:31:41.120,2:31:47.680
in a non-real but real context i mean playing 
like you are a character in a theater then you

2:31:47.680,2:31:53.040
knew you know that you are doing something that 
seems real but it's not real that's like a game

2:31:53.040,2:32:00.560
but now you are playing like a character and all 
this brings us to play as fun because um people

2:32:00.560,2:32:07.201
enjoy uh doing this thing they enjoy they are they 
have a lot of positive emotion and they are also

2:32:07.840,2:32:16.080
counterbalanced by negative emotions at that time 
but these emotions this effervescence uh against

2:32:16.080,2:32:22.640
uh robots and the relationship with robots give 
rise to really interesting scenarios from the

2:32:22.640,2:32:30.080
science fiction and there are four examples of 
robots that are purely autonomous imaginative

2:32:30.080,2:32:35.840
they are driven by emotions even if they are 
not supposed to have emotion for instance in the

2:32:35.840,2:32:42.479
the lady on the right is a robot named arisa in a 
series that you can find on netflix better than us

2:32:42.479,2:32:49.759
and she ends up in sacrificing herself to 
prevent the life of the family and she is

2:32:49.760,2:32:56.720
in love with the dad of the family but there as 
you can see also yule bruner just before um is

2:32:56.720,2:33:04.160
uh is a pure uh emotionless robot he's killing 
people in the first movie in the 70s of um of

2:33:05.359,2:33:13.759
west westworld but he's driven by anger so um he 
shows no emotion but he's killing people because

2:33:13.760,2:33:21.200
uh he wants to he wants revenge against the human 
all this is developed in the realm of scenario in

2:33:21.200,2:33:27.679
the real imagination and so on but on the field 
when i'm studying uh for instance in the easier

2:33:28.399,2:33:34.639
this uh this robot that you can see on the on the 
left the so-called baxter robot in which their

2:33:34.640,2:33:42.880
motion um trying to trying to make this motion 
more sophisticated and the uh two examples taken

2:33:42.880,2:33:48.399
from an exhibition in which they are collaborative 
robots small ones that are supposed to be vacuum

2:33:48.399,2:33:54.639
cleaner robots collaborative with each other and 
the famous paper which is welcoming people at the

2:33:54.640,2:34:02.560
uh start the uh at the door of the exhibition 
and then we get back to a crude reality and

2:34:02.560,2:34:07.760
one of the researchers in robotics told me we 
are quite far from terminator and around three

2:34:08.720,2:34:15.680
and then why there are so different narrative 
and um you know that we know we all know that

2:34:15.680,2:34:22.399
technologies are embedded in nets of meaning and 
to enter it in this narrative but uh do these

2:34:22.399,2:34:29.679
autonomous devices need narrative and of what kind 
and i allow myself the the chance to divide this

2:34:29.680,2:34:34.319
narrative in between scientific narrative and 
fiction narrative even if they mix each other

2:34:34.319,2:34:40.639
the distinction between the the two of them is 
just purely theoretical but scientific narratives

2:34:40.640,2:34:47.680
tell history of technology and fiction narrative 
that history about about technology and leave room

2:34:47.680,2:34:54.720
to very strange things that are coming up to be 
reality right now for instance imagining that

2:34:54.720,2:35:01.040
there are robots everywhere like in the drawings 
helping children helping elder people and bringing

2:35:01.680,2:35:08.160
parcels to homes and so on and making love with 
a robot find something that you can imagine but

2:35:08.160,2:35:14.960
these two images are also counterbalanced 
by the fact that we uh uh already have uh

2:35:14.960,2:35:22.960
uh virtual girlfriends in japan and uh so 
this wasn't essay um and and the papers in

2:35:24.560,2:35:30.960
helping for elder people in their homes so 
we are not quite far from scientific and

2:35:30.960,2:35:36.880
fiction narrative in the reality that we are 
living but the most interesting is not that

2:35:36.880,2:35:42.960
okay we can explore and explore and explore these 
fictional narratives but these narratives end up

2:35:42.960,2:35:48.960
being storytelling for robotics organizations 
and enterprises first there are a lot of people

2:35:48.960,2:35:53.840
are telling us that this is the story this 
is a theological narrative we are going

2:35:54.479,2:36:00.319
towards the inescapable origin of robots in 
society and that's almost human in society and

2:36:00.319,2:36:08.399
there are two famous enterprises that use a lot of 
uh media technologies such as youtube to produce

2:36:08.960,2:36:16.960
uh different videos uh hanson robotics and boston 
dynamics they are very famous and the first one is

2:36:16.960,2:36:24.720
created sofia this human shape robot face which 
is able to have a conversation with the humans

2:36:24.720,2:36:33.840
and these are very famous very uh sports uh robots 
that are keen to accomplish very very uh difficult

2:36:35.280,2:36:43.439
motions and these are very spectacular performance 
and they are broadcast intentionally by these

2:36:43.439,2:36:48.639
enterprises and this is fascinating for the wide 
audience and a lot of people discussing this as

2:36:48.640,2:36:55.201
oh this is the future robots you see that women 
robots and these uh these very strong and even um

2:36:56.640,2:37:01.200
military robots and but this is upsetting 
for the robotician i'm working with

2:37:01.200,2:37:06.319
they said okay this is just spectacular 
things but this is not the reality of robotics

2:37:06.319,2:37:13.280
as it is developing right now but 
interestingly uh these same atoms to

2:37:13.280,2:37:19.519
broadcast the um the performance of robotics 
brings about dystopian scenario and this is all um

2:37:20.479,2:37:28.879
except for the uh killer robot uh down in the 
slide but the two ones the robots is fighting back

2:37:29.760,2:37:35.040
boston dynamics roadways is fighting back against 
human and uh sofia van hansen robotics telling

2:37:35.040,2:37:43.760
okay i will destroy humans these are fake um fake 
videos but um this means that the kind of uh janus

2:37:44.560,2:37:51.120
side of the of the coin when you try to broadcast 
an eutopian future and said okay we live with

2:37:51.120,2:37:58.000
this very very powerful performance and very 
powerful robots and immediately they are also

2:37:59.359,2:38:06.319
contrary visions and contrary imaginations and 
then it brings me i'm almost finished to the what

2:38:06.319,2:38:12.479
i call the cultural walls in digital revolution 
because my approach is also a sociological one

2:38:12.479,2:38:17.040
i'm trying to understand position discourse and 
framework of imagination and the way they are

2:38:17.040,2:38:24.560
intentions and from this field work i'm framed for 
ideative attitudes to aaa and robots especially

2:38:24.560,2:38:29.200
robots in this case what i call technologies 
that means engineers and technicians that are

2:38:29.200,2:38:35.359
elaborating robots and most of them told me that 
okay this is all but spectacular screen and this

2:38:35.359,2:38:41.280
is a software and we are trying to frame algorithm 
and then to see to test the movement and the part

2:38:41.280,2:38:47.840
of the law and so on and this is quite long and 
quite rigorous uh way of of doing things and on

2:38:47.840,2:38:54.160
the other side they are what i call technologies 
don't leave guys that come on tv and write books

2:38:54.160,2:38:59.760
and say okay the future of the digital age will 
be robots everywhere sometimes they are the same

2:38:59.760,2:39:06.240
elon musk for instance is a pure technology 
and uh these prophets of the digital age

2:39:07.120,2:39:17.359
and describe the future as a full of these devices 
may be it for uh critic critics be it for kind of

2:39:17.359,2:39:24.080
valorization of this also there are technophilians 
developers and users that are fascinated by these

2:39:24.080,2:39:30.880
new technologies and technophobians okay four 
positions but the surprise come by the fact that

2:39:30.880,2:39:38.880
we are not only and not really in a face-to-face 
confrontation with you on the one side those

2:39:38.880,2:39:44.800
who believe in the future of robots and robotics 
and say okay there are technologies we live robots

2:39:44.800,2:39:51.280
will be like gods like new angels like new spirits 
of the time and the other side technologies that

2:39:51.280,2:39:56.479
bring this back to the crude reality and 
saying that this is not exactly that this

2:39:56.479,2:40:04.319
we have to be rationalists this is all all but all 
that reality and more most of the time we find in

2:40:04.319,2:40:09.519
the scientific literature this kind of tension 
between rationality and irrationality but it's

2:40:09.520,2:40:14.800
much more complex than that because first i 
give two examples technologies for instance can

2:40:14.800,2:40:20.880
be technophobians and in my field work i met some 
people that create robots but fear the development

2:40:20.880,2:40:26.720
of aaa in the same time these are the same people 
and this is the complexity of human feelings and

2:40:26.720,2:40:32.399
human attitudes and for instance on the other 
way uh technophilians people that like this

2:40:32.399,2:40:38.719
technology are not always always technologies and 
most of the user in your ignore the process on and

2:40:38.720,2:40:46.160
the design of creating technologies and finally 
technologies can inspire but not always and annoy

2:40:46.160,2:40:51.840
but also inspire technologies for instance we 
know that in france they are they have been not in

2:40:51.840,2:40:59.200
france not only but elsewhere invitation from the 
government um and the organization and invitation

2:40:59.200,2:41:06.160
for scientists and authors to imagine matching and 
scenario for the for the future so it's not only

2:41:06.160,2:41:12.559
coming from the technological mid and slide 
and i'm finished and sometimes technologist

2:41:12.560,2:41:17.600
meets technology and there is at least one 
enterprise in france i'm doing field work with who

2:41:17.600,2:41:25.439
level their products enchanted tools and i set up 
even a marvel section because when they create aaa

2:41:25.439,2:41:30.799
and robots they know that they are designed with 
their own history and the imaginary framework they

2:41:30.800,2:41:36.560
sell you the robots and the cultural and symbolic 
universe of the robot they all come together

2:41:36.560,2:41:42.399
and like alice and wonderland in the same 
time you cannot have without the others and

2:41:42.399,2:41:47.599
this kind of reconciliation in between fiction and 
science fiction between imagination and technology

2:41:48.160,2:41:56.000
uh then uh this is thanks to imagination robots 
then there are more much more in the line of

2:41:56.000,2:42:03.040
social exception acceptation and and this 
enterprise is supposed to be on the technologist

2:42:03.040,2:42:11.359
really rationalist regional side uh leave room 
for uh imagination and uh help this creative

2:42:11.359,2:42:19.519
relationship uh with robots and a.m and blur the 
frontiers and give party ground for imagination

2:42:19.520,2:42:27.200
i come from the east side of the of the creators 
of rob and at final reflection just a sum up of

2:42:27.200,2:42:34.080
these points this is all again an ongoing research 
and these are some results but not all the results

2:42:34.080,2:42:40.559
um this paper was just to reflect upon the issues 
of sciences i determined to a digital revolution

2:42:40.560,2:42:46.560
and a very specific object in digital revolution 
especially robots and the anthropological point

2:42:46.560,2:42:51.600
of view that has been adopted here was from 
the bottom from the actor's point of view

2:42:51.600,2:42:57.840
and how and why and who produce what kind 
of technological imagination or imagination

2:42:57.840,2:43:04.640
projected on technologies and these human shape 
devices that are present here today are a good

2:43:04.640,2:43:10.560
example but are not the only one and all have 
been said now i might be counter balanced and

2:43:11.520,2:43:16.880
critically converted to other devices and 
other conditions of producting and using these

2:43:16.880,2:43:24.319
technologies um of course these are technologies 
are also source of different kind of images and

2:43:24.319,2:43:32.319
surrounded by a different framework of imagination 
but my conclusion is creative imagination is not

2:43:32.319,2:43:38.559
always where we think it is and the appropriation 
of these devices in the media of artistic media

2:43:38.560,2:43:50.880
is a key evidence of this point but my look was 
on the technological media and the and uh widening

2:43:50.880,2:43:58.319
communities of roboticians and this imaginary uh 
cultural imaginary then can nurture or prevent

2:43:58.319,2:44:05.840
the advance of and in technologies i mean um and 
this is my final conclusion we always from side to

2:44:05.840,2:44:11.200
side from the beginning of thinking about robots 
a and digital technology and producing them and

2:44:11.760,2:44:18.320
distributing disseminating them in in societies 
and culture think about the the very crucial role

2:44:19.120,2:44:26.479
of imagination it means images and ideologies 
surrounding these technologies thank you

2:44:29.920,2:44:37.920
thank you very much professor obadiah 
for wonderful presentation and i

2:44:37.920,2:44:46.240
love this kind of topics so i have so many 
issues to this i'd like to discuss with you

2:44:46.240,2:44:53.439
but uh the first i'd like to start uh the 
two three more presentation for this session

2:44:53.439,2:45:03.839
then i'd like to discuss all with us so the next 
uh i'd like to welcome miss b chen from china

2:45:04.399,2:45:12.799
she's artist and she's a great artist 
and i'm honored to be welcome here bison

2:45:13.760,2:45:20.880
could you please start your presentation 
sure thanks eduson for the introduction

2:45:21.680,2:45:29.040
um so today i'm going to share some of the 
experience i developed after i returned to china

2:45:30.800,2:45:41.840
so it's great to to be here and so i'm sharing 
the screen now can you see it can you see it

2:45:53.600,2:46:03.840
sorry let me just yeah so i will i will ask 
my avatar to do this presentation for me today

2:46:06.479,2:46:09.839
okay who okay

2:46:18.880,2:46:24.720
yes i can hear you no doubt that technology 
has played an increasingly important role

2:46:24.720,2:46:30.640
since the 20th century humans have 
to face multiple crisis and dilemmas

2:46:30.640,2:46:39.279
from nature society and humans themselves in such 
a closely interconnected world can the collusions

2:46:39.279,2:46:46.080
of different cultures and ideas inspire creations 
that helps technology develop the better solutions

2:46:51.200,2:46:57.920
hello everyone my name is vincent thanks to 
dr either for the invitation it's my great

2:46:57.920,2:47:01.120
pleasure to be here with other 
professionals at this workshop

2:47:03.120,2:47:09.359
i'm interested in the relationship between 
humans and technology to be more specific

2:47:09.359,2:47:14.160
i'm interested in how humans perceive or 
understand technology in a different culture

2:47:15.040,2:47:20.240
i have studied at m8 design interactions 
with professor raby at the london royal

2:47:20.240,2:47:26.000
college of arts that's also why a part of my 
work includes speculative future scenarios

2:47:30.240,2:47:36.960
technology has been around since the dawn of 
humanity from stones for hunting to sticks to join

2:47:37.600,2:47:44.160
all of which are the products of technology 
in human society in this time although

2:47:44.160,2:47:51.359
technology is presented similarly in general due 
to the globalization nowadays since i moved back

2:47:51.920,2:47:54.480
i have found a common phenomenon in china

2:47:55.040,2:48:01.840
people have a pretty different view of technology 
than what i haven't seen in other countries

2:48:05.920,2:48:08.880
there is a park at center of beijing called

2:48:09.439,2:48:14.799
temple of heaven which seems to have become 
a testing ground for local creativity of

2:48:14.800,2:48:21.600
innovation even the toilet in this park have 
equipped it with face recognition technology

2:48:25.279,2:48:31.359
going to the loo in his park must not be an 
overly urgent task like in no times you can

2:48:31.359,2:48:36.399
only get the pieces of toilet paper after taking 
off your head and your glasses and staring at the

2:48:36.399,2:48:43.599
machine for three seconds the slowly dripped 
toilet paper is limited each time so if you

2:48:43.600,2:48:51.439
need more you may have to repeat the progress 
a few times before go into the toilet oh and

2:48:51.439,2:48:57.839
you can also get the toilet paper from the front 
looking of pikachu i have texted through my phone

2:49:00.800,2:49:04.640
there are many more cases here 
from a noodles performance robot

2:49:05.439,2:49:12.559
to a piano that can grill lamp kebabs to 
the shenzhen's smartphones chinese citizens

2:49:12.560,2:49:20.240
have unique optimistic altitudes on technology 
these attitudes re-establishments how they live

2:49:20.240,2:49:25.840
in their living environment which 
also influenced my art creations

2:49:29.040,2:49:35.680
the ancient chinese cosmology there's a set of 
thoughts and rules behind the seemingly magical

2:49:35.680,2:49:45.040
talisman it is a virtual miss blended with reality 
such as rim making ceremony and at the same time

2:49:45.040,2:49:52.240
is the most sensory reflection of how people 
at each time have understood their natural

2:49:52.240,2:50:00.479
environment resembles the way how algorithms and 
data shapes are meant fulu is a thousand talisman

2:50:01.040,2:50:09.120
that uses writing a meditation spell and spiritual 
power to scare away evil spirits attract fortune

2:50:09.120,2:50:16.640
or perceived peace in the space they are hung 
up or paced onto fulu is a drawing consisting

2:50:16.640,2:50:23.680
of chinese characters with a mythological origin 
more than writing that merely describes the word

2:50:24.399,2:50:32.479
these characters have a magical relationship with 
them that allows them to act upon reality nowadays

2:50:32.479,2:50:39.679
the word of network's timo lecra gradually 
adopts and even replaces reality benefit tissue's

2:50:39.680,2:50:46.880
narrative of data becomes resources or even 
capsule the emergence of blockchain technology

2:50:46.880,2:50:52.319
and its decentralized worldview make it possible 
for internet nomads to build a better life

2:50:54.240,2:51:00.319
and these fictions are often regarded 
as objective depictions of reality

2:51:02.319,2:51:09.120
the character shu in old chinese means method 
skill extending from the meaning of the past

2:51:10.000,2:51:16.319
shu also expressed both technology and the 
witchcraft which presents fiction there are also

2:51:16.319,2:51:24.080
cases of fictional transformations of reality 
in the records of dynasty in the novel heroes

2:51:24.080,2:51:31.439
of wood marine may eventually their depictions of 
diced monks and rivers who armed solely with diced

2:51:31.439,2:51:40.319
tools and witchcraft were able to overcome the 
machines and bring liberation for exploited people

2:51:42.000,2:51:49.760
continuing with this fiction or ancient wish of 
the qing dynasty i have created a speculative work

2:51:49.760,2:51:56.080
a series of contemporary fools for the society 
that is entirely overtaken by technology

2:51:57.359,2:52:03.759
this attempts to help people break the current 
human dilemma that both by the technology

2:52:04.319,2:52:07.840
and to explore the value of fictional realities

2:52:10.000,2:52:14.399
in this work i invited hong kong 
calligrapher quinzo to invent

2:52:15.279,2:52:21.439
some food together to harness the invisible 
magnetism of algorithms in combination with

2:52:21.439,2:52:28.160
ancient beliefs for example the image on 
the screen is for bitcoin holders it can

2:52:28.160,2:52:35.519
convert any electronic devices into a bitcoin 
mining machine for attracting more bitcoins

2:52:36.880,2:52:45.840
we decided to let this alternative future 
so so now you can get those flu online

2:52:55.120,2:52:55.840
technology

2:52:58.000,2:53:02.560
new techniques a type of liberation 
and autonomy or just enough

2:53:07.439,2:53:10.559
use in space be liberated or trapped

2:53:17.840,2:53:18.560
in his book

2:53:22.479,2:53:23.839
only

2:53:28.720,2:53:33.360
thoughts have succeeded in tips but

2:53:35.920,2:53:41.040
also helped general products not all asian

2:53:43.680,2:53:51.840
essentially in the exact nature like this

2:53:59.439,2:53:59.939
hmm

2:54:04.160,2:54:05.840
peace on

2:54:08.560,2:54:10.161
is is it disconnected

2:54:12.720,2:54:20.960
hello b sound are you here hello okay i think 
i saw some icons appear on my laptop said

2:54:20.960,2:54:27.760
connection is not good can you hear 
me now can you hear me now yes yes

2:54:27.760,2:54:35.680
okay so i will start sharing again 
okay okay can i say it yes okay cool

2:54:45.040,2:54:47.840
you

2:54:49.040,2:54:58.160
to allow the public to encounter their world 
anew a german noise assignment transported 1999

2:54:58.160,2:55:04.960
used smartphones on trolley surreal streets of 
berlin and google maps recognized this activity

2:55:04.960,2:55:10.880
by turning a green street red and automatically 
producing a virtual traffic jam on the map

2:55:11.600,2:55:17.439
the fictional activity also affected the 
physical world where smart navigation

2:55:17.439,2:55:25.599
directed cars to alternative routes to avoid 
being stuck in this traffic this is not racket

2:55:28.000,2:55:37.279
poses potentially to generate fictions often take 
as accurate attentions of reality another example

2:55:37.279,2:55:44.160
is sunday island image at the right side was 
featured by google earth through their satellites

2:55:44.160,2:55:52.160
imagery and market in the contemporary digital 
charts such as google maps from 1876 until october

2:55:52.160,2:55:59.200
2012 when scientists finally discovered that the 
island have never existed the marina favor is a

2:55:59.200,2:56:05.679
network commissioned by unesco creative cities 
to critique the relationship between humans and

2:56:05.680,2:56:12.560
technology as game is one of the common mechanism 
used in my creative practice i have built a

2:56:12.560,2:56:19.120
telephone game with the artificial intelligence 
program tits translated in his work the text

2:56:19.120,2:56:24.800
is translated between 10 rooted and distant 
language families to decipher the original text

2:56:25.600,2:56:31.840
after the text has been translated and 
re-translated the original meaning is lost and the

2:56:31.840,2:56:39.200
cyber formatted linguistic endpoints is obtained 
the project results from negotiating questions

2:56:39.760,2:56:46.720
such as chameleon be accurately represented in 
translation from human accessibility to machine

2:56:46.720,2:56:54.479
logic what does it say about us trusting the 
perfection of computers over the sentimentally

2:56:54.479,2:57:00.879
of humans using these questions as a 
foundation running human or philosophical

2:57:00.880,2:57:08.080
text through a programmatic data obscures 
the language mechanically the resulting text

2:57:10.160,2:57:16.559
visual images its final step relieves 
on the intuitive and imprecise thinking

2:57:16.560,2:57:21.840
that mirrors human perception 
english writer and creative

2:57:24.160,2:57:33.359
we only see what we look at to look is an act 
of choice i think art is particularly important

2:57:33.359,2:57:38.719
in this area than ever as everything 
in its reality is attached to capsule

2:57:39.439,2:57:46.559
by reviving the power of fiction art change the 
real world in the current technological context

2:57:47.520,2:57:53.360
to generate awareness for technology for 
work citizens to rethink their current states

2:57:54.080,2:58:03.840
to catalysts for the better futures and 
that's my talk today thank you very much

2:58:04.560,2:58:11.680
oh wow oh thank you very much uh your 
presentation is also an art hard work

2:58:13.120,2:58:19.840
very beautiful thank you very 
much yeah yeah thank you very much

2:58:20.399,2:58:28.000
i have many questions to you but uh i'd 
like to proceed to the next presentation

2:58:28.000,2:58:35.040
then and let's discuss so i'd like to welcome 
mangaly and martin mozarix from inaliya

2:58:35.920,2:58:42.480
so could you please start your presentation 
yes i'm sharing my screen thank you

2:58:45.200,2:58:45.840
and that's

2:58:49.920,2:58:51.840
oops so

2:58:56.399,2:59:07.839
is it working yes it is indeed um so thank you 
again for inviting us and my name is magali and

2:59:07.840,2:59:14.319
in the name of indriya cnrs and lucia and 
tehrani america we would like to to thank

2:59:14.319,2:59:24.160
you dr um koichiro etosan for this invite and also 
the french and japanese foundation and early kid

2:59:25.279,2:59:30.639
i'm sorry but our presentation is going to be 
very different because it's uh to share the

2:59:30.640,2:59:37.520
project we are working on at the moment in um help 
maritime in the south of france sophia antipolis

2:59:38.160,2:59:44.000
and um thank you to all of you for your 
excellent and exciting uh presentation and

2:59:44.000,2:59:49.520
i'm still very very impressed uh by being 
shane as well and it's going to be hard

2:59:50.560,2:59:58.080
to talk after her so tehran america is 
digital sciences at your fingertips it's

2:59:58.080,3:00:02.000
something like we would like people 
to discover explore and experiment

3:00:04.080,3:00:10.880
so why terrain america because like 
gravity digital is like everywhere and yet

3:00:13.840,3:00:15.360
digital till divide

3:00:22.319,3:00:29.840
people know how to use their phone their laptop 
but they don't know how what's behind it and

3:00:29.840,3:00:38.800
uh for terra in america it's very important 
uh to um engage people and and and share with

3:00:38.800,3:00:46.640
them so they can be uh independent with digitals 
and what's going on in this in this a new world

3:00:47.840,3:00:57.520
so very often we hear that these are not my 
cup of tea and despite the very good quality of

3:00:59.520,3:01:07.120
qual of science mediation with high attendance 
at science fair open doors conferences

3:01:07.120,3:01:17.439
courses digital is not yet considered not as 
a part of our culture as art is so therefore

3:01:18.560,3:01:28.240
we sorry i'm not very up so therefore tyranny 
america um wants to disseminate uh the the

3:01:28.240,3:01:36.880
knowledge to the largest possible number of 
people and we aim at um being a good vector

3:01:36.880,3:01:44.080
for digital sciences in education and then bring 
equal opportunities for everybody boys and girls

3:01:44.880,3:01:52.560
also why terrain america in our territory it's 
a very rich territory in interactions with

3:01:53.200,3:02:01.840
arts as you may know the south of 
france alpha mari timber and provence

3:02:03.279,3:02:13.519
was is still a very attractive place for artists 
um so many came and stay and and produce in in the

3:02:13.520,3:02:24.000
area it's a very rich territory for art schools 
and like victorian studios as recently reopened

3:02:24.000,3:02:34.399
so cinema interactions lots of students and in 
society police and in nice and too long as well

3:02:34.399,3:02:44.080
a lot of research centers and private companies so 
very big nice area to to share and to to carry on

3:02:45.680,3:02:50.880
so the main goal of tehran america was to 
bring together the whole digital sciences

3:02:50.880,3:03:01.439
actor which were on our territory and it was 
to not build well build something new but also

3:03:01.439,3:03:08.719
uh bring together all the people to make their 
experience and expertise in scientific meditation

3:03:08.720,3:03:17.600
their innovation creativity co-activities stronger 
also we very um we're very keen in training

3:03:17.600,3:03:25.840
teachers professors and and sharing 
devices all devices around digital sciences

3:03:29.120,3:03:32.240
so tehran america is a project still

3:03:33.279,3:03:40.080
it started we are now very i'm 
sorry sorry sorry sorry he lost my

3:03:42.160,3:03:49.760
we are now supported by our two funding 
members cnrs india and universite cote d'azur

3:03:51.439,3:04:01.120
we we have fully members from different areas 
like research and higher education laboratories

3:04:01.120,3:04:10.399
schools association private companies and local 
authorities as well our goal is to finally have

3:04:10.399,3:04:19.920
a big space to share and to show digital sciences 
but not only all the earn their interactivities

3:04:20.640,3:04:32.720
but also we are very keen on going in mainly 
in interland um area because lots of secondary

3:04:32.720,3:04:41.200
schools high schools multimedia libraries 
don't always have access to those opportunities

3:04:43.439,3:04:53.200
we we have very open we are very open-minded 
and we've got like at the moment 150 people

3:04:53.760,3:05:01.040
working all together and including 
citizens students scientific administrative

3:05:01.040,3:05:04.479
staff artists everybody is is very welcome

3:05:07.200,3:05:17.840
so to give you a brief history of the project 
the project was born in into december 2018.

3:05:18.399,3:05:29.040
we were only four at the moment so in in 2 2019 
we had to present and convince people and finally

3:05:30.000,3:05:38.319
we got a name and a logo which is tehran 
america we got our first funding and first a key

3:05:38.319,3:05:54.160
achievement for tehran america in 2020 2020 then 
2021 um it was time for our um our um sorry our

3:05:55.279,3:06:01.920
research centers to sign an agreement 
and to encourage us to to carry on

3:06:02.720,3:06:10.479
so 2020 is 2022 is a big step for us because we 
are going to have a new pad as we said a very

3:06:10.479,3:06:19.200
big space 500 square meters where we are going 
to put down everything and it's going to be

3:06:19.200,3:06:26.880
able um a place for sharing for researchers 
and people citizens to come and enter and

3:06:26.880,3:06:37.359
visit visitors and attend any kind of activities 
and the final goal for terra numerica in 2025

3:06:38.479,3:06:45.040
with the help of the local authorities 
is to open a dedicated place

3:06:47.600,3:06:56.399
to science meditation sorry meditation 
popularization of digital sciences and

3:06:56.399,3:07:02.799
we had the confirmation a few months 
ago so we are going to have like

3:07:04.000,3:07:11.040
5 500 meters just for terra numerica and 
just next to it same place in sofianti police

3:07:12.319,3:07:20.479
5 500 square meters for heart and science 
linked to terrain america and in connections

3:07:21.279,3:07:28.240
and after that the adventurers goes on we've 
got to carry on and work and produce and invent

3:07:28.240,3:07:35.679
and be different and attract more people 
so this is the place we we are going to

3:07:36.960,3:07:45.040
uh invest very soon um where people are 
uh will be able to come and and visit and

3:07:45.040,3:07:51.840
it will be like the digital science fair all 
your all year round sorry and what we want is

3:07:52.640,3:08:02.000
to support innovative thinking inspire create 
share with everybody who's happy to come and um

3:08:03.279,3:08:11.840
also we've got a little well not a little we would 
like to develop art and science in our project

3:08:12.640,3:08:18.080
and so just let open the 
windows on art and science and

3:08:19.200,3:08:25.279
as picasso said everything you can imagine is 
real and this is what we are doing with terranim

3:08:25.279,3:08:35.920
america but not only so we've got um an agreement 
with espace archon de and we are going to work we

3:08:35.920,3:08:42.720
are already working with them like jean-pierre as 
well uh showed you his project he's going to work

3:08:42.720,3:08:48.960
with with them as well and we would like to 
cross views between artists and scientists

3:08:49.760,3:08:56.960
so that could be a different level like for 
instance the first example is robert de lune

3:08:56.960,3:09:04.080
and you can as an artist the creation 
and what an artist at inoria can create

3:09:04.080,3:09:14.000
around the knee triangulations producing 
um producing algorithm so that's an example

3:09:15.040,3:09:23.600
another example could be that that's a neural 
networks from another artist statin area and how

3:09:23.600,3:09:29.840
your imagination could interpret 
neural networks in a different way

3:09:32.160,3:09:40.160
one of our scientists frederick avi who could 
not be there and dorian mazurik they both work

3:09:40.160,3:09:50.960
with this espar concrete and for instance this 
is the work of carl andre which is a famous

3:09:51.760,3:10:00.000
sculpture american sculpture and it's the queens 
of on the work of heart and it's mixing hearts

3:10:00.000,3:10:10.720
mathematics and algorithm as you can see also 
we've got heart is everywhere and there is another

3:10:10.720,3:10:19.359
project which is a spiral is in shape and it's an 
approach a multi-disciplinary approach and in this

3:10:19.359,3:10:27.519
case we want to erase awareness of observation 
reflection via the spiral as a mathematical

3:10:28.319,3:10:37.200
object or sharing with science and technology 
but not only like for instance the origami um

3:10:37.200,3:10:46.319
origami to us could be um a way to also 
introduce deep learning but very vulgarated

3:10:46.319,3:10:55.519
but deep learning as you repeat the same gesture 
to train and to make your origami become alive

3:10:55.520,3:11:01.520
so that could be you know lots of connections to 
explain science and the interconnections between

3:11:02.080,3:11:08.239
um heart history of art and 
and whatever okay so we are um

3:11:09.439,3:11:17.679
beginning to be a bigger project with a lot of 
ambitions and any contributions would be very very

3:11:17.680,3:11:24.640
uh welcome um we we can share with you 
seminars creative and innovating project

3:11:25.200,3:11:31.679
and also from what we heard this morning new 
certificate new scientific research approaches

3:11:32.239,3:11:40.000
and it would be very uh important for us 
to carry on any kind of collaboration so

3:11:42.720,3:11:49.840
this is just a little video i hope it works and

3:11:53.279,3:12:03.840
huh

3:12:12.960,3:12:13.460
oops

3:12:15.520,3:12:22.720
so thank you very much to harry gatou 
gozaimasu we will we heard about your

3:12:22.720,3:12:27.680
summer school at the beginning and we would 
be very happy to maybe uh collaborate with you

3:12:28.399,3:12:36.160
also in next november in society police at 
indriya we're on organizing an aca tech with

3:12:37.680,3:12:44.960
young students and researchers and one 
of the major group research area would

3:12:44.960,3:12:50.720
be heart and sciences because we believe 
we can create and do lots of new things

3:12:52.560,3:13:03.121
and we we've got to in in the area we also 
hold the project troisi ah koichiro etosan

3:13:03.760,3:13:08.640
you you've already heard about it so 
you could have a lot of interactions

3:13:08.640,3:13:17.760
around ia with a lot of scientists but 
not only twice a year tehran america have

3:13:18.960,3:13:27.520
called for projects so we've got little finance to 
give the opportunity to artists or to scientists

3:13:27.520,3:13:37.280
to collaborate and to work together and being a 
non-artist and a non-scientific and living with

3:13:38.720,3:13:48.080
living and working with scientific and artists 
i believe that there is no um that's it's not a

3:13:48.080,3:13:54.239
different word it's the same word sometimes 
as jean-pierre and some of you already said

3:13:54.960,3:14:02.640
the communication the the wording is not the same 
but the creativity and your sensitivity is just

3:14:02.640,3:14:11.280
the same uh always i often hear mathematician 
say oh i'm so happy my algorithm is so beautiful

3:14:12.160,3:14:21.120
and it's in the same aspect that an artist could 
share his whatever production and also my final

3:14:22.880,3:14:30.399
sharing is next time um we we would be very 
honored uh to make a little video for tehran

3:14:30.399,3:14:38.639
america or whatever and and talk with now 
uh toki sensei and maybe have his music

3:14:38.640,3:14:44.480
in back in the background to be more 
innovative thank you again arigato gozaimasu

3:14:46.640,3:14:53.760
thank you very much for your presentation 
makali-sang then uh our presentation was

3:14:53.760,3:15:01.760
finished for session two so we'd like to 
start a discussion of uh of this session

3:15:02.880,3:15:11.840
then uh thank you thank you for all then i'd 
like to start a question to uh from myself

3:15:12.640,3:15:23.680
so why do you say can you hear me yeah i do yeah 
maybe you you have a limited time to so i'd like

3:15:23.680,3:15:30.640
to start question for you no no i i actually 
have plenty of time because if uh if it's

3:15:32.800,3:15:37.040
a quarter to ten two two up 
past 12 in france this is

3:15:37.040,3:15:42.800
one hour left i'm in great britain now so i 
have a lot of time not a lot but i have time

3:15:43.359,3:15:50.719
uh okay thank you uh i i'd like to ask you the 
uh many questions but uh at the first one point

3:15:51.680,3:16:00.239
uh how do you think the differences between the 
west and the east was for thinking about the

3:16:00.239,3:16:08.399
dystopia scenario for the future uh i i think that 
there is a uh how can i say increased by from the

3:16:10.000,3:16:20.160
fiction nobel for example frankenstein uh as 
you know a scientific science fiction novelist

3:16:20.160,3:16:27.920
uh isaac ashimov named it as a syndrome 
of a frankenstein so how do you think the

3:16:29.760,3:16:40.160
scenario is different for the west and the east oh 
the question of cultural relativity i heard that

3:16:40.160,3:16:47.120
um well um we have the same i have i i i'm jumping 
aside and i'm coming back to the discussion right

3:16:47.120,3:16:54.239
now i'm also working on another uh um mediatic 
and the cultural creator named the zombie and you

3:16:54.239,3:16:59.439
know there is huge discussion regarding if it's 
a production of the western imagination and if it

3:16:59.439,3:17:05.919
can also be rooted in the in non-western culture 
and civilization given that the relationship

3:17:05.920,3:17:11.840
in between the body culture the imagination of 
after after death and so on are quite different

3:17:12.479,3:17:19.120
from uh way on the way to another depending 
not only on culture but and i'm getting back

3:17:19.120,3:17:28.080
to the point on history uh you know that the 
the um on not only culture but also history

3:17:28.640,3:17:34.000
for instance the the degree of uh historical 
trauma that you have for instance for walls

3:17:34.000,3:17:40.560
and uh the very specific relationship that you 
can have with technology and uh for instance you

3:17:40.560,3:17:46.880
japan invented godzilla and now this is the 
universal feature now the character that we

3:17:46.880,3:17:53.840
we can see everywhere but you invited it and and 
this now belongs to the global popular culture

3:17:54.399,3:18:01.200
and it can be recognized everywhere and so i think 
that there are framework for dystopian scenarios

3:18:03.120,3:18:12.080
similar on some aspects with a local variations 
regarding the uh very specific national history

3:18:12.080,3:18:17.920
uh let's say on the background of global 
history but but national histories for instance

3:18:18.640,3:18:26.160
and that's why uh there is a huge distribution 
of of this uh dystopian scenarios but um if you

3:18:26.160,3:18:32.160
allow me just one more second i'm i'm a bit 
talkative but just one second this dystopian

3:18:32.160,3:18:38.880
scenarios has also grounds for the acceptation 
of this for instance the fact that we all know

3:18:38.880,3:18:47.359
who is frankenstein creator and we all accepted 
that we can create such uh let's say animals or

3:18:48.000,3:18:55.040
or human-like creatures regardless of the the 
outcomes and the fact that the creator can kill

3:18:55.040,3:19:03.760
the the create creator can kill the creator but 
you can fear a very specific scheme or object or

3:19:03.760,3:19:10.880
sign of symbol but accept it and 
dystopian can also be uh imaginary indeed

3:19:10.880,3:19:17.840
geological ideological facilitator for the 
acceptation of these things in my opinion

3:19:19.920,3:19:24.560
interesting i have this kind 
of a scientific fiction story

3:19:26.080,3:19:34.239
there are so many cultural background differences 
so maybe we can deepen this uh kind of stories

3:19:34.239,3:19:44.639
very much but uh i'd like to make broader to this 
uh topics uh so i'd like to ask you uh uh being

3:19:44.640,3:19:54.479
some uh how do you think the uh described stories 
from the east side and uh your presentation is uh

3:19:54.479,3:20:04.319
wonderful and also it's playful so uh i'm very 
interested in your story to a playful future

3:20:05.520,3:20:12.000
ah president can you can repeat the question 
again sorry uh i think the internet is not

3:20:12.000,3:20:21.120
evil in the uh you created the future 
scenario as a good site or a prayer site

3:20:22.800,3:20:30.479
i'm very interested in where did you come 
from this kind of attitude altitude you mean

3:20:30.479,3:20:39.040
the work i just created oh yeah okay well i think 
it's quite it's quite complicated because as

3:20:39.040,3:20:46.479
an artist i think any experience is going to 
our creation so i think my creation slightly

3:20:47.840,3:20:55.680
starts changing because i was moved back to 
china since 2020 and from then i think the whole

3:20:55.680,3:21:01.279
involvement and also the people how people are 
using the technology and the people's optimistic

3:21:01.279,3:21:08.239
altitudes on the technology in this whole 
environment is quite shocked me so so that that's

3:21:08.239,3:21:14.880
you can see that's my analyze um of how what 
happens in these environments like from my slides

3:21:14.880,3:21:22.239
just in my presentation and so from that i 
was thinking um compared to the study i would

3:21:22.239,3:21:31.120
compare to the the life experience um when i was 
in london and i seen like quite different view

3:21:31.680,3:21:39.760
in china that everyone can so close engage with 
the technology that they bring the technology

3:21:39.760,3:21:49.600
uh fragments into their daily lives and then so 
in that case um i think here everybody is artists

3:21:49.600,3:21:56.880
they are creating they're creating um their 
how can i say they use their creation to

3:21:56.880,3:22:06.479
actually um build the future day by day person by 
person and so when i seen this also i was raising

3:22:06.479,3:22:13.200
myself as an artist was the responsibility of 
being an artist in this technological arrow um

3:22:13.200,3:22:19.840
so basically i'm more like critics on 
technology through my artworks um and uh

3:22:20.399,3:22:26.719
and uh yeah that's that's that's experience again 
um from from the from beijing from china here

3:22:29.920,3:22:31.040
i'm not sure if i don't say it

3:22:33.279,3:22:39.120
yeah it's wonderful answer that 
everybody is an artist in china yeah

3:22:41.359,3:22:47.920
it's quite like you can't really you can't 
really feel which parts is the reality and

3:22:47.920,3:22:54.800
which part is fiction it's kind of all 
mixed up together the things you see in

3:22:59.040,3:23:05.519
it may next day appear in a daily life like in 
china you never know every day is a surprise

3:23:07.439,3:23:08.719
interesting thank you very much

3:23:14.479,3:23:26.479
for sang can you hear me magazine i have a 
question for you that how would you like to

3:23:27.279,3:23:34.479
make a place to collaborate with 
artists in your project can you hear me

3:23:37.120,3:23:37.840
nobody saying

3:23:41.040,3:23:44.080
he is not in a list of the names anymore wow

3:23:46.800,3:23:47.520
okay then

3:23:50.399,3:23:52.000
she came here again

3:23:56.319,3:24:03.599
if somebody have questions to uh 
speakers uh you can feel free to uh

3:24:04.399,3:24:10.799
on microphone then start to talk 
or please say something from chat

3:24:14.239,3:24:15.040
can you hear me

3:24:18.479,3:24:28.000
yes sorry shiro i lost you and i had to connect 
again ah okay so uh i'd like to i'll repeat the

3:24:28.000,3:24:36.080
question to you okay thank you i have a question 
uh is it any uh plan to make a collaborative

3:24:36.080,3:24:43.760
collaborative space in your project is there 
any future plan to collaborate with artists

3:24:45.680,3:24:52.400
oh yes indeed we we would like to to do that 
i mean jean-pierre is already an example

3:24:54.160,3:25:02.880
so far we have approached the ah concrete in 
satu but we would like to carry on and extend and

3:25:04.720,3:25:12.160
even outside the area the national i 
mean the france or elsewhere because like

3:25:12.160,3:25:22.559
we are going to have one 1 500 meters dedicated 
to art and science and it's very important to

3:25:23.920,3:25:30.720
to collaborate and to extend and so there are 
so many local artists as well it's a very rich

3:25:32.000,3:25:38.720
territory so yes we are very uh keen 
on on collaborating uh koichiro with

3:25:39.520,3:25:44.800
you or any person who would like and 
also it is very important as you said

3:25:44.800,3:25:51.600
it's opening a new reflection on science 
um aspects like uh with social environment

3:25:51.600,3:25:57.440
and with heart and the connections 
and i gather our project it's at uh

3:25:59.680,3:26:04.800
at um a level just under your creativity

3:26:04.800,3:26:11.680
because for us the important is to share 
like we explain uh ia with a wooden

3:26:11.680,3:26:19.920
machine we've got lots of and it's to make 
people more confident and to show them that um

3:26:21.920,3:26:31.200
digital a is everywhere but like art is everywhere 
as well to us so it's important that people trust

3:26:31.200,3:26:39.599
and feel more confident and it's uh it's like 
religion has lionel uh i think it was leonel

3:26:40.640,3:26:47.200
made them the relation i mean it's everyday you've 
got to convince people you've got and especially

3:26:47.200,3:26:54.479
after what we've been through with the kovid 
you can all see that there is a lack of on on

3:26:55.279,3:27:02.960
believing in science or in scientists so the 
problematics is everywhere and we've got to um

3:27:02.960,3:27:06.000
carry on but yes we will be 
very happy to collaborate

3:27:08.960,3:27:17.920
i'm looking forward to collaborating with you yes 
we ideally we would we would have loved to welcome

3:27:17.920,3:27:25.040
you in in march sometimes but because you are 
going back to japan maybe next time with pleasure

3:27:25.040,3:27:33.359
koichiro yeah thank you very much thank you so 
this is a time for discussion so uh is there any

3:27:33.359,3:27:41.839
uh questions uh between a speaker to a speaker 
uh we we are welcome to talk we have from you

3:27:54.160,3:28:03.519
i have one but meditate it will bring us 
very far okay i can try to jump here um

3:28:04.239,3:28:10.639
since you work with the on the one side there is 
a close connection with artists and on the other

3:28:10.640,3:28:19.840
side you are working as in in in the heart of 
technology um how do you get the issue of crafting

3:28:22.319,3:28:25.679
on the one side and creating 
on the other side all together

3:28:26.880,3:28:31.840
this is not an easy question this is a theoretical 
question i'm sorry for that but i know that there

3:28:31.840,3:28:38.160
are spaces right now in sciences where creation uh 
yeah you know crafting science is really inspired

3:28:38.160,3:28:51.840
by by heart and and and reciprocally so uh both of 
you are one of you um how do you tackle this issue

3:28:53.520,3:29:01.201
well okay we have the main research 
area which is assistance for frey people

3:29:01.840,3:29:05.840
but at the same time we allowed us to wander

3:29:08.160,3:29:18.479
on other topics that are not really connected to 
our main research areas it happened in workshop

3:29:18.479,3:29:26.799
it happened in meeting well you know quite well 
that we have a lot of administrative meetings

3:29:29.120,3:29:38.720
and we try to make the best of them meaning 
that we have the opportunity to meet other

3:29:38.720,3:29:44.479
colleagues working in very different domains 
and what surprised me no doesn't surprise me but

3:29:44.479,3:29:51.120
what happened is that i see some kind of 
convergence in science as well meaning that

3:29:53.680,3:30:00.960
for example we have people trying to tackle 
numerical fluids problems and it just happens that

3:30:00.960,3:30:04.880
if you discuss with them during 
lunch you will see that they have

3:30:05.760,3:30:11.120
problems that are very similar 
to what problem you have and

3:30:13.120,3:30:18.880
you have developed algorithm for solving this 
problem they have developed their own algorithm

3:30:19.760,3:30:26.960
and it happens quite quickly frequently um 
that uh well their tools may be quite useful

3:30:26.960,3:30:31.920
for us and reciprocally and in fact 
it's it's i will say it's just random

3:30:31.920,3:30:40.640
meeting uh so we just kiss with lawyers we discuss 
with biologists i have a biologist in my team

3:30:42.160,3:30:45.519
i will say just the open discussion

3:30:48.319,3:30:55.439
there is no systematic way to do it we have done a 
systematic approach at the beginning when we move

3:30:55.439,3:31:02.319
to industrial robotics to assistance robotics we 
spend two years making a lot of interviews with

3:31:04.080,3:31:12.080
customers help us medical community 
local authorities and really

3:31:12.080,3:31:17.920
it was very useful because we learned a lot of 
things we learned to avoid a lot of mistakes

3:31:17.920,3:31:22.640
which are very easy to make and i think 
that with artists it just happens that

3:31:23.760,3:31:31.359
it happens once a long time ago the world 
spread among the artists there is some team in

3:31:31.359,3:31:37.599
south of france which may help us to do whatever 
we want so this started accumulating and

3:31:39.040,3:31:45.760
the world spreads and that's it but there 
is no process for that in my opinion

3:31:49.439,3:31:53.839
thank you

3:32:02.720,3:32:10.080
sorry sorry so i was saying that uh in my first 
life at irkam when i was mostly working on

3:32:12.239,3:32:20.639
computer-assisted composition software tools we 
we had two kind of interactions between scientists

3:32:20.640,3:32:29.120
and artists in in the first situation the artist 
would come to the scientist with a problem

3:32:29.120,3:32:39.040
for instance a musical problem and would ask for 
help and expertise and algorithm and sometimes a

3:32:39.840,3:32:47.279
problem that was explained in a very lengthy 
way and seemed very complicated actually could

3:32:47.279,3:32:54.080
be solved with a very simple scientific or 
technological device or a simple algorithm

3:32:54.720,3:33:01.680
and sometimes a problem that seemed extremely 
simple to the artist and the artist thought that

3:33:01.680,3:33:04.800
he would really just need a 
little help to to achieve it

3:33:05.359,3:33:12.559
would actually become a huge scientific 
problem and maybe sometimes an unsolvable one

3:33:14.720,3:33:21.840
and this is very very interesting because it 
shows that the perception of complexity is very

3:33:21.840,3:33:28.640
different between artists and scientists 
scientists have issues of computability

3:33:29.520,3:33:37.840
which is a very difficult topic as as as you 
know and uh things that that are very obvious

3:33:37.840,3:33:45.840
in real life uh can become extremely 
difficult to model actually in in uh

3:33:46.479,3:33:54.160
a quantitative approach and sometimes the artists 
have a hard time understanding this because what

3:33:54.160,3:34:00.639
is simple for them and or complex and complicated 
for them it's totally different from what the

3:34:00.640,3:34:06.880
scientists would uh tackle as simple or complex 
so so we had this strange relationship in the

3:34:06.880,3:34:12.000
first place with the in the situation where the 
artist would come to the to the to the scientists

3:34:13.120,3:34:21.519
and asked so to speak for a service we had another 
kind of interaction which which went the other

3:34:21.520,3:34:27.439
way around so the scientists are also creative 
and creators except that they create scientific

3:34:27.439,3:34:34.239
theories or algorithms or models and they would 
come up with ideas of new models new algorithm

3:34:34.800,3:34:41.200
new fields and then they would talk about it 
because of course we have a lot of places to

3:34:41.200,3:34:48.239
talk workshops conferences seminars etc and then 
the artist would would come to the scientists and

3:34:48.239,3:34:54.319
say oh i never thought about that it's absolutely 
fascinating and it gives me an id for a new work

3:34:54.319,3:35:03.279
for a new piece maybe we can collaborate and so 
in this situation uh uh uh it it it would be it

3:35:03.279,3:35:09.359
would be the ideas coming from the scientist who 
would inform and influence the artist so that was

3:35:09.359,3:35:17.120
a traditional uh divide that was a traditional 
dichotomy between uh art and science as

3:35:17.120,3:35:24.960
a as a service-based relationship or art and 
science as a transfer or influence or transfer

3:35:25.520,3:35:30.960
of ids from one field to another it's two very 
different approaches and of course we we had

3:35:30.960,3:35:38.160
to cope with both but since i've been working on 
interactive and creative ai that is designing uh

3:35:38.720,3:35:44.399
kind of artificial create creatures that can live 
by themselves and interact on stage with musicians

3:35:44.399,3:35:50.719
now we're on in a very different situation because 
the the the concern now of the musician is how can

3:35:51.520,3:35:59.200
how can i have this artificial creature shut up 
for a moment because which is which is exactly

3:35:59.200,3:36:03.200
a question of control because we don't know 
really how to control them for instance we have

3:36:03.200,3:36:10.239
algorithm ai algorithm that generate music and do 
real-time machine learning in live situations etc

3:36:10.239,3:36:17.279
and they play music sometimes in a very smart way 
but they they they don't we see we still don't

3:36:17.279,3:36:27.040
have the cognitive model of intentionality and 
intrinsic motivation and all this that that makes

3:36:27.680,3:36:34.640
that that that can help us to decide when to start 
and when to stop doing something so generally

3:36:34.640,3:36:39.359
generally the the human who starts the computer 
and then the computer plays music it doesn't know

3:36:39.359,3:36:46.239
when to stop so so the the the human would would 
really like to have some more control uh over that

3:36:46.239,3:36:55.279
and so we so we are now moving to to uh to a 
paradigm of control and how to understand uh uh uh

3:36:55.279,3:37:05.200
uh control in the in the case where you have kind 
of artificial uh um uh agents uh that that have a

3:37:05.200,3:37:11.279
that have a certain autonomy so the problem has 
totally shifted to to to this new issue of control

3:37:13.439,3:37:15.040
i think just what that

3:37:17.760,3:37:24.399
just one thing that uh i have to mention is that 
there is a parallel between in our collaboration

3:37:24.399,3:37:31.920
with that uh with a collaboration we have with 
doctors you have to be quite careful when you

3:37:31.920,3:37:39.040
do that for example if you go when you meet a 
doctor for the first time and tell him look you

3:37:39.040,3:37:46.479
have currently a medical process and i will teach 
you how to change it and to do it very efficiently

3:37:46.479,3:37:52.959
so you want to change everything then you are 
dead you have to learn to be incremental meaning

3:37:55.359,3:38:02.160
you have to simply state okay you have a 
process i will not change it i will just

3:38:03.359,3:38:11.599
help you on a given detail of this process to do 
it in a better way or to do it for you something

3:38:11.600,3:38:19.600
that you have currently doing we will avoid trying 
to do an example when you do a walking analysis

3:38:19.600,3:38:25.840
of a patient there is a classical test where you 
measure the time the guy takes to make 10 meter in

3:38:26.880,3:38:32.880
this straight line so so the surgeon 
is looking as at the chronometer

3:38:34.239,3:38:42.080
of looking at the way the guy is walking so 
the first thing we do is okay we will avoid you

3:38:42.080,3:38:46.160
looking at the chronometer because our 
machine will measure all the time for you

3:38:46.160,3:38:56.080
that's it they say okay because it was no big 
change for them and then we say well we can

3:38:56.080,3:39:00.399
measure also some of the things for example 
we have measured during this experiment this

3:39:00.399,3:39:09.040
particularity oh they say oh you can measure 
that so incrementally we add things we were able

3:39:09.040,3:39:16.160
to do since the very start of the program but we 
won't we don't want to say that at the beginning

3:39:18.239,3:39:27.760
and the doctors learnt like the artists and when 
the request or the suggestion does not come from

3:39:27.760,3:39:37.120
us but from the doctors you have measured that but 
be possible to measure also that that we know we

3:39:37.120,3:39:44.319
have win and it's exactly the same process with 
artists in our first collaboration we were just

3:39:44.319,3:39:52.559
attacking with a small minor detail in the 
artwork showing it can be done and progressively

3:39:52.560,3:39:58.239
that you say oh you have been able to do that i 
would like to do another thing can you do it for

3:39:58.239,3:40:06.160
me and that's okay if you are these steps then you 
know that the collaboration will be quite fruitful

3:40:08.239,3:40:09.199
you have to be perfect

3:40:11.840,3:40:16.960
to fight your to fight your own mind we 
say okay we have this problem i know how

3:40:16.960,3:40:22.880
to deal with it completely and efficiently you 
have to learn that to be careful not do that

3:40:30.880,3:40:36.160
yes it is very smart uh approach and 
as you say the relation between artists

3:40:36.160,3:40:40.720
and scientists is a very delicate one and 
one has to treat it uh in a very delicate

3:40:45.279,3:40:47.920
yeah way you very much uh for

3:40:48.880,3:40:59.840
the cube okay and uh i think uh i we are 
almost running out of time for discussion so uh

3:41:09.120,3:41:13.840
no

3:41:40.800,3:41:48.319
okay uh uh okay uh i'd like to uh uh 
conclude this q a discussion session

3:41:48.319,3:41:55.040
and uh also uh this workshop so thank 
you very much for all participants

3:41:56.160,3:42:02.880
in this workshop you know for food 
for a discussion in this time so

3:42:07.040,3:42:17.359
can i across or who is a speaker for closing 
remarks yes i think you can you can conclude here

3:42:17.359,3:42:24.960
because i think sebastian the chevalier uh jean 
vivian had to left earlier so you can conclude

3:42:26.479,3:42:33.519
okay i'd like to conclude this workshop 
and there was a wonderful presentation

3:42:33.520,3:42:39.520
so many wonderful presentations and 
uh there's so many issues to how to

3:42:40.560,3:42:47.520
deepen the relationship between uh art 
and advanced technology in this society

3:42:47.520,3:42:56.720
so i am very thankful to all the participants 
and for speakers and audience uh thank you very

3:42:56.720,3:43:05.840
much for making this workshop possible uh so i'd 
like to to end this workshop thank you very much

3:43:12.880,3:43:15.600
thanks a lot thank you thank you very much

3:43:18.319,3:43:27.199
thanks everyone thank you thanks 
take care bye bye thank you bye
